Several financial aid initiatives, unique to Brown, have been developed in order to better assist our families. The following is an overview of these initiatives:\n\n- Undergraduate financial aid applicants with total parent incomes less than \\$100,000, at the time of admission, do not have a loan component in their awards. Students with family earnings above $\\$ 100,000$ have moderate loans ( $\\$ 3,000, \\$ 4,000$, or $\\$ 5,000$ ) depending on family total income level.\n- Families with total parent earnings less than $\\$ 60,000$ and assets less than $\\$ 100,000$ are not required to make a contribution toward the cost of education.\n- Families with total parent earnings less than $\\$ 60,000$ and assets greater than $\\$ 100,000$ have a significantly reduced contribution (from assets only).\n- Students are able to use outside scholarships to eliminate all of the student-effort components in their awards including the summer savings expectation.\n\nThese University initiatives are determined based on a family's calculated total income. A family's total income is determined by reviewing tax documents and financial aid application materials. Total income is the sum of Adjusted Gross Income plus all untaxed income. Examples of untaxed income include untaxed social security benefits, untaxed business revenue, pension contributions and withdrawals, child support received, etc.","images":[],"dimensions":{"dpi":200,"height":2201,"width":1700}},{"index":23,"markdown":"# I.
