Students with family earnings above $\\$ 100,000$ have moderate loans ( $\\$ 3,000, \\$ 4,000$, or $\\$ 5,000$ ) depending on family total income level.\n- Families with total parent earnings less than $\\$ 60,000$ and assets less than $\\$ 100,000$ are not required to make a contribution toward the cost of education.\n- Families with total parent earnings less than $\\$ 60,000$ and assets greater than $\\$ 100,000$ have a significantly reduced contribution (from assets only).\n- Students are able to use outside scholarships to eliminate all of the student-effort components in their awards including the summer savings expectation.\n\nThese University initiatives are determined based on a family's calculated total income. A family's total income is determined by reviewing tax documents and financial aid application materials. Total income is the sum of Adjusted Gross Income plus all untaxed income. Examples of untaxed income include untaxed social security benefits, untaxed business revenue, pension contributions and withdrawals, child support received, etc.","images":[],"dimensions":{"dpi":200,"height":2201,"width":1700}},{"index":24,"markdown":"# I.

Undergraduate class sections are defined as any sections in which at least one degree-seeking undergraduate student is enrolled for credit.

Exclude students in independent study, co-operative programs, internships, foreign language taped tutor sessions, practicums, and all students in one-on-one classes. Each class section should be counted only once and should not be duplicated because of course catalog cross-listings.\n\nClass Subsections: A class subsection includes any subsection of a course, such as laboratory, recitation, and discussion subsections that are supplementary in nature and are scheduled to meet separately from the lecture portion of the course. Undergraduate subsections are defined as any subsections of courses in which degree-seeking undergraduate students enrolled for credit. As above, exclude noncredit classes and individual instruction such as dissertation or thesis research, music instruction, or one-to-one readings. Each class subsection should be counted only once and should not be duplicated because of cross-listings.\nUsing the above definitions, please report for each of the following class-size intervals the number of class sections and class subsections offered in Fall 2011.
