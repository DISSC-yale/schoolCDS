Exclude students in independent study, co-operative programs, internships, foreign language taped tutor sessions, practicums, and all students in one-on-one classes. Each class section should be counted only once and should not be duplicated because of course catalog cross-listings.\n\nClass Subsections: A class subsection includes any subsection of a course, such as laboratory, recitation, and discussion subsections that are supplementary in nature and are scheduled to meet separately from the lecture portion of the course. Undergraduate subsections are defined as any subsections of courses in which degree-seeking undergraduate students enrolled for credit. As above, exclude noncredit classes and individual instruction such as dissertation or thesis research, music instruction, or one-to-one readings.

If you prefer, you can compute the percentages using 1st majors only.\n\n| Category | Diploma/ Certificates | Associate | Bachelor's | CIP 2020 Categories to Include |\n| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |\n| Agriculture |  |  | 0.0\\% | 1 |\n| Natural resources and conservation |  |  | $1.9 \\%$ | 3 |\n| Architecture |  |  | $0.7 \\%$ | 4 |\n| Area, ethnic, and gender studies |  |  | $2.9 \\%$ | 5 |\n| Communication/journalism |  |  | $1.5 \\%$ | 9 |\n| Communication technologies |  |  | $0.0 \\%$ | 10 |\n| Computer and information sciences |  |  | $12.3 \\%$ | 11 |\n| Personal and culinary services |  |  | $0.0 \\%$ | 12 |\n| Education |  |  | $1.1 \\%$ | 13 |\n| Engineering |  |  | $4.8 \\%$ | 14 |\n| Engineering technologies |  |  | $0.0 \\%$ | 15 |\n| Foreign languages, literatures, and linguistics |  |  | $2.4 \\%$ | 16 |\n| Family and consumer sciences |  |  | $0.0 \\%$ | 19 |\n| Law/legal studies |  |  | $0.0 \\%$ | 22 |\n| English |  |  | $5.2 \\%$ | 23 |\n| Liberal arts/general studies |  |  | $0.0 \\%$ | 24 |\n| Library science |  |  | $0.0 \\%$ | 25 |\n| Biological/life sciences |  |  | $10.8 \\%$ | 26 |\n| Mathematics and statistics |  |  | $9.3 \\%$ | 27 |\n| Military science and military technologies |  |  | $0.0 \\%$ | 28 \\& 29 |\n| Interdisciplinary studies |  |  | $5.6 \\%$ | 30 |\n| Parks and recreation |  |  | $0.0 \\%$ | 31 |\n| Philosophy and religious studies |  |  | $1.8 \\%$ | 38 |\n| Theology and religious vocations |  |  | $0.0 \\%$ | 39 |\n| Physical sciences |  |  | $2.8 \\%$ | 40 |\n| Science technologies |  |  | $0.0 \\%$ | 41 |\n| Psychology |  |  | $2.9 \\%$ | 42 |\n| Homeland Security, law enforcement, firefighting, and protective services |  |  | $0.0 \\%$ | 43 |\n| Public administration and social services |  |  | $0.7 \\%$ | 44 |\n| Social sciences |  |  | $20.7 \\%$ | 45 |\n| Construction trades |  |  | $0.0 \\%$ | 46 |\n| Mechanic and repair technologies |  |  | $0.0 \\%$ | 47 |\n| Precision production |  |  | $0.0 \\%$ | 48 |\n| Transportation and materials moving |  |  | $0.0 \\%$ | 49 |\n| Visual and performing arts |  |  | $4.6 \\%$ | 50 |\n| Health professions and related programs |  |  | $3.4 \\%$ | 51 |\n| Business/marketing |  |  | $1.7 \\%$ | 52 |\n| History |  |  | $2.8 \\%$ | 54 |\n| Other |  |  |  |  |\n| TOTAL (should $=100 \\%$ ) |  |  | $100.0 \\%$ |  |","images":[],"dimensions":{"dpi":200,"height":2201,"width":1700}},{"index":29,"markdown":"# Common Data Set Definitions \n\n## All definitions related to the financial aid section appear at the end of the Definitions document.\n\nItems preceded by an asterisk (*) represent definitions agreed to among publishers which do not appear on the CDS document but Additional guidance for some terms, particularly those common with the IPEDS survey, may be found here:\nhttps://surveys.nces.ed.gov/ipeds/public/glossary\n*Academic advisement: Plan under which each student is assigned to a faculty member or a trained adviser, who, through regular meetings, helps the student plan and implement immediate and long-term academic and vocational goals.\nAccelerated program: Completion of a college program of study in fewer than the usual number of years, most often by attending summer sessions and carrying extra courses during the regular academic term.\nAdmitted student: Applicant who is offered admission to a degree-granting program at your institution.\n*Adult student services: Admission assistance, support, orientation, and other services expressly for adults who have started college for the first time, or who are re-entering after a lapse of a few years.\nAmerican Indian or Alaska Native: A person having origins in any of the original peoples of North and South America (including Central America) and maintaining tribal affiliation or community attachment.\nApplicant (first-time, first year): An individual who has fulfilled the institution's requirements to be considered for admission (including payment or waiving of the application fee, if any) and who has been notified of one of the following actions: admission, nonadmission, placement on waiting list, or application withdrawn (by applicant or institution).\nApplication fee: That amount of money that an institution charges for processing a student's application for acceptance.
