Each class section should be counted only once and should not be duplicated because of course catalog cross-listings.\n\nClass Subsections: A class subsection includes any subsection of a course, such as laboratory, recitation, and discussion subsections that are supplementary in nature and are scheduled to meet separately from the lecture portion of the course. Undergraduate subsections are defined as any subsections of courses in which degree-seeking undergraduate students enrolled for credit. As above, exclude noncredit classes and individual instruction such as dissertation or thesis research, music instruction, or one-to-one readings. Each class subsection should be counted only once and should not be duplicated because of cross-listings.\n\nUsing the above definitions, please report for each of the following class-size intervals the number of class sections and class subsections offered in Fall 2004. For example, a lecture class with 800 students who met at another time in 40 separate labs with 20 students should be counted once in the \"100+\" column in the class section column and 40 times under the \"20-29\" column of the class subsections table.\n\nNumber of Class Sections with Undergraduates Enrolled\n\n| Undergraduate Class Size (provide numbers) |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |\n| CLASS <br> SECTIONS | 2-9 | 10-19 | 20-29 | 30-39 | 40-49 | 50-99 | 100+ | Total |\n|  | 170 | 197 | 107 | 57 | 49 | 54 | 21 | 655 |\n|  | $26 \\%$ | $30 \\%$ | $16 \\%$ | $9 \\%$ | $7 \\%$ | $8 \\%$ | $3 \\%$ | $100 \\%$ |\n| CLASS SUB- <br> SECTIONS | 2-9 | 10-19 | 20-29 | 30-39 | 40-49 | 50-99 | 100+ | Total |\n|  | 30 | 52 | 36 | 24 | 5 | 1 | 0 | 148 |\n|  | $20 \\%$ | $35 \\%$ | $24 \\%$ | $16 \\%$ | $3 \\%$ | $1 \\%$ | $0 \\%$ | $100 \\%$ |\n| TOTAL | 2-9 | 10-19 | 20-29 | 30-39 | 40-49 | 50-99 | 100+ | Total |\n|  | 200 | 249 | 143 | 81 | 54 | 55 | 21 | 803 |\n|  | $25 \\%$ | $31 \\%$ | $18 \\%$ | $10 \\%$ | $7 \\%$ | $7 \\%$ | $3 \\%$ | $100 \\%$ |","images":[],"dimensions":{"dpi":200,"height":2200,"width":1700}},{"index":27,"markdown":"# J. Degrees Conferred \n\n## J1 Degrees conferred between July 1, 2003 and June 30, 2004\n\nFor each of the following discipline areas, provide the percentage of diplomas/certificates, associate, and bachelor degrees awarded. To determine the percentage, use majors, not headcount (e.g., students with one degree but a double major will be represented twice). Calculate the percentage from your institution's IPEDS Completions by using the sum of first and second majors for each CIP code as the numerator and the sum of the Grand Total by First Major and the Grand Total by Second Major as the denominator. (If you prefer, you can compute the percentages using first majors only.)\n\n| Category | Diploma/ Certificates | Associate | Bachelor's | CIP 2000 Categories |\n| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |\n| Agriculture |  |  |  | 1 |\n| Architecture |  |  |  | 4 |\n| Area and ethnic studies |  |  | $1 \\%$ | 5 |\n| Biological/life sciences |  |  | $9 \\%$ | 26 |\n| Business/marketing |  |  | $10 \\%$ | 52 |\n| Communications/communication technologies |  |  |  | 9 and 10 |\n| Computer and information sciences |  |  | $7 \\%$ | 11 |\n| Education |  |  | $<1 \\%$ | 13 |\n| Engineering/engineering technologies |  |  | $26 \\%$ | 14 and 15 |\n| English |  |  | $3 \\%$ | 23 |\n| Foreign languages and literature |  |  | $3 \\%$ | 16 |\n| Health professions and related sciences |  |  | $4 \\%$ | 51 |\n| Home economics and vocational home economics |  |  | $1 \\%$ | 19 |\n| Interdisciplinary studies |  |  | $2 \\%$ | 30 |\n| Law/legal studies |  |  |  | 22 |\n| Liberal arts/general studies |  |  | $<1 \\%$ | 24 |\n| Library science |  |  |  | 25 |\n| Mathematics |  |  | $2 \\%$ | 27 |\n| Military science and technologies |  |  |  | 29 |\n| Natural resources/environmental science |  |  | $<1 \\%$ | 3 |\n| Parks and recreation |  |  |  | 31 |\n| Personal and miscellaneous services |  |  |  | 12 |\n| Philosophy, religion, theology |  |  | $2 \\%$ | 38 and 39 |\n| Physical sciences |  |  | $7 \\%$ | 40 and 41 |\n| Protective services/public administration |  |  |  | 43 and 44 |\n| Psychology |  |  | $8 \\%$ | 42 |\n| Social sciences and history |  |  | $14 \\%$ | 45 and 54 |\n| Trade and industry |  |  |  | 46, 47, 48, 49 |\n| Visual and performing arts |  |  | $1 \\%$ | 50 |\n| Other |  |  |  |  |\n| TOTAL | $0 \\%$ | $0 \\%$ | $100 \\%$ |  |","images":[],"dimensions":{"dpi":200,"height":2200,"width":1700}}],"model":"mistral-ocr-2503-completion","usage_info":{"pages_processed":28,"doc_size_bytes":578062}}
