Use the chart below to determine inclusions and exclusions:\n\n|  |  | Full-Time | Part-Time |\n| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |\n| (a) | instructional faculty in preclinical and clinical medicine, faculty who are not paid (e.g., those who donate their services or are in the military), or research-only faculty, post-doctoral fellows, or pre-doctoral fellows | Exclude | Include only if they teach one or more non-clinical credit courses |\n| (b) | administrative officers with titles such as dean of students, librarian, registrar, coach, and the like, even though they may devote part of their time to classroom instruction and may have faculty status | Exclude | Include only if they teach one or more non-clinical credit courses |\n| (c) | other administrators/staff who teach one or more nonclinical credit courses even though they do not have faculty status | Exclude | Include |\n| (d) | undergraduate or graduate students who assist in the instruction of courses, but have titles such as teaching assistant, teaching fellow, and the like | Exclude | Exclude |\n| (e) | faculty on sabbatical or leave with pay | Include | Exclude |\n| (f) | faculty on leave without pay | Exclude | Exclude |\n| (g) | replacement faculty for faculty on sabbatical leave or leave with pay | Exclude | Include |\n\nFull-time instructional faculty: Faculty employed on a full-time basis for instruction (including those with released time for research).\nPart-time instructional faculty: Adjuncts and other instructors being paid solely for part-time classroom instruction. Also includes full-time faculty teaching less than two semesters, three quarters, two trimesters, or two four-month sessions. Employees who are not considered full-time instructional faculty but who teach one or more non-clinical credit courses may be counted as part-time faculty.\nMinority faculty: Includes faculty who designate themselves as black, non-Hispanic; American Indian or Alaska Native; Asian or Pacific Islander; or Hispanic.\nDoctorate: Includes such degrees as Doctor of Philosophy, Doctor of Education, Doctor of Juridical Science, and Doctor of Public Health in any field such as arts, sciences, education, engineering, business, and public administration.\nFirst-professional: Includes the fields of dentistry (DDS or DMD), medicine (MD), optometry (OD), osteopathic medicine (DO), pharmacy (DPharm or BPharm), podiatric medicine (DPM), veterinary medicine (DVM), chiropractic (DC or DCM), law (JD) and theological professions (MDiv, MHL).\nTerminal master's degree: A master's degree that is considered the highest degree in a field: example, M. Arch (architecture) and MFA (master of fine arts in art or theater).","images":[],"dimensions":{"dpi":200,"height":2200,"width":1700}},{"index":26,"markdown":"|  |  | Full-Time | Part-Time | Total |\n| :-- | :-- | --: | --: | --: |\n| a) | Total number of instructional faculty | 687 | 166 | 853 |\n| b) | Total number who are members of minority groups | 115 | 7 | 122 |\n| c) | Total number who are women | 247 | 77 | 324 |\n| d) | Total number who are men | 440 | 89 | 529 |\n| e) | Total number who are nonresident aliens (international) |  |  | 0 |\n| f) | Total number with doctorate, first professional, or other terminal | 634 | 99 | 733 |\n| degree | 51 | 63 | 114 |  |\n| g) | Total number whose highest degree is a master's but not a terminal | 51 | 63 | 114 |\n| master's | 2 | 4 | 6 |  |\n| h) | Total number whose highest degree is a bachelor's | 2 | 4 | 6 |\n| i) | Total number whose highest degree is unknown or other (Note: |  |  | 0 |\n|  | Items f, g, h, and i must sum up to item a.) |  |  | 0 |\n| j) | Total number in stand-alone graduate / professional programs in | 147 | 56 | 203 |\n|  | which faculty teach virtually only graduate-level students |  |  |  |\n\n# I2 Student to Faculty Ratio \n\nReport the Fall 2005 ratio of full-time equivalent students (full-time plus 1/3 part time) to full-time equivalent instructional faculty (full time plus $1 / 3$ part time).

Undergraduate class sections are defined as any sections in which at least one degree-seeking undergraduate student is enrolled for credit. Exclude distance learning classes and noncredit classes and individual instruction such as dissertation or thesis research, music instruction, or one-to-one readings. Exclude students in independent study, co-operative programs, internships, foreign language taped tutor sessions, practicums, and all students in one-on-one classes. Each class section should be counted only once and should not be duplicated because of course catalog cross-listings.\n\nClass Subsections: A class subsection includes any subsection of a course, such as laboratory, recitation, and discussion subsections that are supplementary in nature and are scheduled to meet separately from the lecture portion of the course. Undergraduate subsections are defined as any subsections of courses in which degree-seeking undergraduate students enrolled for credit. As above, exclude noncredit classes and individual instruction such as dissertation or thesis research, music instruction, or one-to-one readings. Each class subsection should be counted only once and should not be duplicated because of cross-listings.\n\nUsing the above definitions, please report for each of the following class-size intervals the number of class sections and class subsections offered in Fall 2005. For example, a lecture class with 800 students who met at another time in 40 separate labs with 20 students should be counted once in the \"100+\" column in the class section column and 40 times under the \"20-29\" column of the class subsections table.\n\n## Number of Class Sections with Undergraduates Enrolled\n\n|  | Undergraduate Class Size (provide numbers) |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |\n| CLASS <br> SECTIONS | 2-9 | 10-19 | 20-29 | 30-39 | 40-49 | 50-99 | 100+ | Total |\n|  | 166 | 249 | 78 | 87 | 43 | 56 | 25 | 704 |\n|  | $24 \\%$ | $35 \\%$ | $11 \\%$ | $12 \\%$ | $6 \\%$ | $8 \\%$ | $4 \\%$ | $100 \\%$ |\n| CLASS SUB- <br> SECTIONS | 2-9 | 10-19 | 20-29 | 30-39 | 40-49 | 50-99 | 100+ | Total |\n|  | 49 | 53 | 50 | 25 | 3 | 0 | 0 | 180 |\n|  | $27 \\%$ | $29 \\%$ | $28 \\%$ | $14 \\%$ | $2 \\%$ | $0 \\%$ | $0 \\%$ | $100 \\%$ |\n| TOTAL | 2-9 | 10-19 | 20-29 | 30-39 | 40-49 | 50-99 | 100+ | Total |\n|  | 215 | 302 | 128 | 112 | 46 | 56 | 25 | 884 |\n|  | $24 \\%$ | $34 \\%$ | $14 \\%$ | $13 \\%$ | $5 \\%$ | $6 \\%$ | $3 \\%$ | $100 \\%$ |","images":[],"dimensions":{"dpi":200,"height":2200,"width":1700}},{"index":28,"markdown":"# J. Degrees Conferred \n\n## J1 Degrees conferred between July 1, 2004 and June 30, 2005\n\nFor each of the following discipline areas, provide the percentage of diplomas/certificates, associate, and bachelor degrees awarded. To determine the percentage, use majors, not headcount (e.g., students with one degree but a double major will be represented twice). Calculate the percentage from your institution's IPEDS Completions by using the sum of first and second majors for each CIP code as the numerator and the sum of the Grand Total by First Major and the Grand Total by Second Major as the denominator.
