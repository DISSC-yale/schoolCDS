INSTRUCTIONAL FACULTY AND CLASS SIZE \n\nI1 Please report the number of instructional faculty members in each category for Fall 2007. Include faculty who are on your institution's payroll on the census date your institution uses for IPEDS/AAUP. The following definition of instructional faculty is used by the American Association of University Professors (AAUP) in its annual Faculty Compensation Survey. Instructional Faculty is defined as those members of the instructional-research staff whose major regular assignment is instruction, including those with released time for research.

Also includes full-time faculty teaching less than two semesters, three quarters, two trimesters, or two four-month sessions. Employees who are not considered full-time instructional faculty but who teach one or more non-clinical credit courses may be counted as part-time faculty.\nMinority faculty: includes faculty who designate themselves as black, non-Hispanic; American Indian or Alaska Native; Asian or Pacific Islander; or Hispanic.\nDoctorate: includes such degrees as Doctor of Education, Doctor of Juridical Science, Doctor of Public Health, and Doctor of Philosophy degree in any field such as agronomy, food technology, education, engineering, public administration, ophthalmology, or radiology.\nFirst-professional: includes the fields of dentistry (DDS or DMD), medicine (MD), optometry (OD), osteopathic medicine (DO), pharmacy (DPharm or BPharm), podiatric medicine (DPM), veterinary medicine (DVM), chiropractic (DC or DCM), law (JD) and theological professions (MDiv, MHL).\nTerminal degree: the highest degree in a field: example, M.

Undergraduate class sections are defined as any sections in which at least one degree-seeking undergraduate student is enrolled for credit. Exclude distance learning classes and noncredit classes and individual instruction such as dissertation or thesis research, music instruction, or one-to-one readings. Exclude students in independent study, co-operative programs, internships, foreign language taped tutor sessions, practicums, and all students in one-on-one classes. Each class section should be counted only once and should not be duplicated because of course catalog cross-listings.\n\nClass Subsections: A class subsection includes any subsection of a course, such as laboratory, recitation, and discussion subsections that are supplementary in nature and are scheduled to meet separately from the lecture portion of the course. Undergraduate subsections are defined as any subsections of courses in which degree-seeking undergraduate students enrolled for credit. As above, exclude noncredit classes and individual instruction such as dissertation or thesis research, music instruction, or one-to-one readings. Each class subsection should be counted only once and should not be duplicated because of cross-listings.\nUsing the above definitions, please report for each of the following class-size intervals the number of class sections and class subsections offered in Fall 2007. For example, a lecture class with 800 students who met at another time in 40 separate labs with 20 students should be counted once in the \"100+\" column in the class section column and 40 times under the \"20-29\" column of the class subsections table.","images":[],"dimensions":{"dpi":200,"height":2200,"width":1700}},{"index":24,"markdown":"Number of Class Sections with Undergraduates Enrolled\n\n| Undergraduate Class Size (provide numbers) |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |\n| CLASS <br> SECTIONS | 2-9 | 10-19 | 20-29 | 30-39 | 40-49 | 50-99 | 100+ | Total |\n|  | 150 | 324 | 76 | 96 | 46 | 48 | 28 | 768 |\n|  | $20 \\%$ | $42 \\%$ | $10 \\%$ | $13 \\%$ | $6 \\%$ | $6 \\%$ | $4 \\%$ | $100 \\%$ |\n| CLASS SUBSECTIONS | 2-9 | 10-19 | 20-29 | 30-39 | 40-49 | 50-99 | 100+ | Total |\n|  | 56 | 42 | 50 | 26 | 10 | 5 | 0 | 189 |\n|  | $30 \\%$ | $22 \\%$ | $26 \\%$ | $14 \\%$ | $5 \\%$ | $3 \\%$ | $0 \\%$ | $100 \\%$ |\n| TOTAL | 2-9 | 10-19 | 20-29 | 30-39 | 40-49 | 50-99 | 100+ | Total |\n|  | 206 | 366 | 126 | 122 | 56 | 53 | 28 | 957 |\n|  | $22 \\%$ | $38 \\%$ | $13 \\%$ | $13 \\%$ | $6 \\%$ | $6 \\%$ | $3 \\%$ | $100 \\%$ |","images":[],"dimensions":{"dpi":200,"height":2200,"width":1700}},{"index":25,"markdown":"# J.
