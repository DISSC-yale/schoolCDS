To determine the percentage, use majors, not headcount (e.g., students with one degree but a double major will be represented twice). Calculate the percentage from your institution's IPEDS Completions by using the sum of $1^{\\text {st }}$ and $2^{\\text {nd }}$ majors for each CIP code as the numerator and the sum of the Grand Total by 1st Majors and the Grand Total by $2^{\\text {nd }}$ major as the denominator. If you prefer, you can compute the percentages using $1^{\\text {st }}$ majors only.\n\n| Category | Diploma/ Certificates | Associate | Bachelor's | CIP 2020 <br> Categories to Include |\n| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |\n| Agriculture |  |  | $0.0 \\%$ | 1 |\n| Natural resources and conservation |  |  | $1.0 \\%$ | 3 |\n| Architecture |  |  | $0.1 \\%$ | 4 |\n| Area, ethnic, and gender studies |  |  | $0.6 \\%$ | 5 |\n| Communication/journalism |  |  | $0.0 \\%$ | 9 |\n| Communication technologies |  |  | $0.0 \\%$ | 10 |\n| Computer and information sciences |  |  | $9.0 \\%$ | 11 |\n| Personal and culinary services |  |  | $0.0 \\%$ | 12 |\n| Education |  |  | $0.4 \\%$ | 13 |\n| Engineering |  |  | $24.0 \\%$ | 14 |\n| Engineering technologies |  |  | $0.0 \\%$ | 15 |\n| Foreign languages, literatures, and linguistics |  |  | $1.2 \\%$ | 16 |\n| Family and consumer sciences |  |  | $1.1 \\%$ | 19 |\n| Law/legal studies |  |  | $0.0 \\%$ | 22 |\n| English |  |  | $1.5 \\%$ | 23 |\n| Liberal arts/general studies |  |  | $0.2 \\%$ | 24 |","images":[],"dimensions":{"dpi":200,"height":1700,"width":2200}},{"index":65,"markdown":"| Library science |  |  | $0.0 \\%$ | 25 |\n| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |\n| Biological/life sciences |  |  | $12.6 \\%$ | 26 |\n| Mathematics and statistics |  |  | $3.0 \\%$ | 27 |\n| Military science and military technologies |  |  | $0.0 \\%$ | 28 and 29 |\n| Interdisciplinary studies |  |  | $5.7 \\%$ | 30 |\n| Parks and recreation |  |  | $0.0 \\%$ | 31 |\n| Philosophy and religious studies |  |  | $0.8 \\%$ | 38 |\n| Theology and religious vocations |  |  | $0.0 \\%$ | 39 |\n| Physical sciences |  |  | $4.5 \\%$ | 40 |\n| Science technologies |  |  | $0.0 \\%$ | 41 |\n| Psychology |  |  | $6.2 \\%$ | 42 |\n| Homeland Security, law enforcement, firefighting, and protective services |  |  | $0.0 \\%$ | 43 |\n| Public administration and social services |  |  | $0.0 \\%$ | 44 |\n| Social sciences |  |  | $9.9 \\%$ | 45 |\n| Construction trades |  |  | $0.0 \\%$ | 46 |\n| Mechanic and repair technologies |  |  | $0.0 \\%$ | 47 |\n| Precision production |  |  | $0.0 \\%$ | 48 |\n| Transportation and materials moving |  |  | $0.0 \\%$ | 49 |\n| Visual and performing arts |  |  | $2.8 \\%$ | 50 |\n| Health professions and related programs |  |  | $6.6 \\%$ | 51 |\n| Business/marketing |  |  | $8.7 \\%$ | 52 |\n| History |  |  | $0.9 \\%$ | 54 |\n| Other |  |  |  |  |\n\n# END OF SECTION J","images":[],"dimensions":{"dpi":200,"height":1700,"width":2200}}],"model":"mistral-ocr-2503-completion","usage_info":{"pages_processed":66,"doc_size_bytes":5535009}}
