Each class subsection should be counted only once and should not be duplicated because of cross-listings.\nUsing the above definitions, please report for each of the following class-size intervals the number of class sections and class subsections offered in Fall 2022. For example, a lecture class with 800 students who met at another time in 40 separate labs with 20 students should be counted once in the \"100+\" column in the class section column and 40 times under the \"20-29\" column of the class subsections table.\n\n## Number of Class Sections with Undergraduates Enrolled\n\n| Undergraduate Class Size (provide numbers) |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |\n|  | 2-9 | 10-19 | 20-29 | 30-39 | 40-49 | 50-99 | 100+ | Total |\n| CLASS <br> SECTIONS | 167 | 614 | 519 | 280 | 211 | 302 | 193 | 2,286 |\n|  | 2-9 | 10-19 | 20-29 | 30-39 | 40-49 | 50-99 | 100+ | Total |\n| CLASS SUB- <br> SECTIONS | 224 | 550 | 644 | 111 | 50 | 44 | 7 | 1,630 |","images":[],"dimensions":{"dpi":200,"height":2934,"width":2267}},{"index":25,"markdown":"# J.
