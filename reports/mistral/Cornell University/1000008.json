Student to Faculty Ratio\n\nReport the Fall 2003 ratio of full-time equivalent students (full-time plus $1 / 3$ part time) to full-time equivalent instructional faculty (full time plus $1 / 3$ part time). In the ratio calculations, exclude both faculty and students in stand-alone graduate or professional programs such as medicine, law, veterinary, dentistry, social work, business, or public health in which faculty teach virtually only graduate level students. Do not count undergraduate or graduate student teaching assistants as faculty.\n\nFall 2003 Student to Faculty ratio: $\\qquad$ to 1 .","images":[],"dimensions":{"dpi":200,"height":2200,"width":1700}},{"index":25,"markdown":"# Common Data Set 2003-2004 \n\n## I-3. Undergraduate Class Size\n\nIn the table below, please use the following definitions to report information about the size of classes and class sections offered in the Fall 2003 term.\n\nClass Sections: A class section is an organized course offered for credit, identified by discipline and number, meeting at a stated time or times in a classroom or similar setting, and not a subsection such as a laboratory or discussion session. Undergraduate class sections are defined as any sections in which at least one degree-seeking undergraduate student is enrolled for credit. Exclude distance learning classes and noncredit classes and individual instruction such as dissertation or thesis research, music instruction, or one-to-one readings. Exclude students in independent study, co-operative programs, internships, foreign language taped tutor sessions, practicums, and all students in one-on-one classes. Each class section should be counted only once and should not be duplicated because of course catalog cross-listings.\n\nClass Subsections: A class subsection includes any subsection of a course, such as laboratory, recitation, and discussion subsections that are supplementary in nature and are scheduled to meet separately from the lecture portion of the course. Undergraduate subsections are defined as any subsections of courses in which degree-seeking undergraduate students enrolled for credit. As above, exclude noncredit classes and individual instruction such as dissertation or thesis research, music instruction, or one-to-one readings. Each class subsection should be counted only once and should not be duplicated because of cross-listings.\n\nUsing the above definitions, please report for each of the following class-size intervals the number of class sections and class subsections offered in Fall 2003. For example, a lecture class with 800 students who met at another time in 40 separate labs with 20 students should be counted once in the \" $100+$ \" column in the class section column and 40 times under the \" 20 29\" column of the class subsections table.\n\n## Number of Class Sections with Undergraduates Enrolled\n\n| Undergraduate Class Size (provide numbers) |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |\n|  | 2-9 | $10-19$ | 20-29 | 30-39 | 40-49 | 50-99 | 100+ | Total |\n| CLASS <br> SECTIONS | 207 | 399 | 237 | 137 | 91 | 175 | 142 | 1388 |\n|  | 2-9 | $10-19$ | 20-29 | 30-39 | 40-49 | 50-99 | 100+ | Total |\n| CLASS SUB- <br> SECTIONS | 609 | 1124 | 435 | 136 | 49 | 58 | 14 | 2425 |","images":[],"dimensions":{"dpi":200,"height":2200,"width":1700}},{"index":26,"markdown":"# Common Data Set 2003-2004 \n\n## J.
