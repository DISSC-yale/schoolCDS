Many of the items and definitions in the Common Data Set will be used on the fall surveys of several major publishers. The goal of the CDS is to improve the comparability of data reported by colleges and to ease each institution's burden by asking questions in a standard way on numerous surveys.

Undergraduate Class Size \n\nIn the table below. please use the following definitions to report information about the size of classes and class sections offered in the Fall 2001 term.\n\nClass Sections: A class section is an organized course offered for credit, identified by discipline and number, meeting at a stated time or times in a classroom or similar setting, and not a subsection such as a laboratory or discussion session. Undergraduate class sections are defined as any sections in which at least one degree-seeing undergraduate student is enrolled for credit. Exclude distance learning classes and noncredit classes and individual instruciton such as dissertation or thesis research, music instruction, or one-toone readings. Exclude students in independent study, co-operative programs, internships, foreign language taped tutor sessions, practicums, and all studnets in one-on-one classes. Each class section should be counted only once and should not be duplicated because of source catalog cross-listings.\n\nClass subsections: A class subsection includes any subsection of a course, such as laboratory, recitation, and discussion subsections that are supplementary in nature and are scheduled to meet separately from the lecture portion of the course. Undergraduate subsections are defined as any subsections of courses in which degree-seeking undergraduate students enrolled for credit. As above, exclude noncredit classes and individual instruction such as dissertation or thesis research, music instruction, or one-to-one readings. Each class subsection should be counted only once and should not be duplicated because of cross-listings.\n\nUsing the above definitions, please report for each of the following class-size intervals the number of class sections and class subsections offered in Fall 2001.
