INSTRUCTIONAL FACULTY AND CLASS SIZE \n\n## I-1. Please report number of instructional faculty members in each category for Fall 2000.\n\nThe following definition of instructional faculty is used by the American Association of University Professors (AAUP) in its annual Faculty Compensation Survey. Instructional Faculty is defined as those members of the instructional research staff whose major regular assignment is instruction, including those with released time for research. Institutions are asked to EXCLUDE:\n\n1. instructional faculty in preclinical and clinical medicine\n2. administrative officers with titles such as dean of students, librarian, registrar, coach, and the like, even though they may devote part of their time to classroom instruction and may have faculty status\n3. undergraduate or graduate students who assist in the instruction of courses, but have titles such as teaching assistant, teaching fellow, and the like,\n4. faculty on leave without pay, and\n5. replacement faculty for faculty on sabbatical leave.\n\n## DEFINITIONS\n\n- Full-time: Faculty employed on a full-time basis\n- Part-time: Faculty teaching less than two semesters, three quarters, two trimesters, or two fourmonth sessions. Also includes adjuncts and part-time instructors.\n- Minority faculty: includes faculty who designate themselves as black, non-Hispanic; American Indian or Alaskan native; Asian or Pacific Islander; or Hispanic.\n- Doctorate: Includes such degrees as Ed.D in education, JSD in Juridical Science, Doctor of Public Health, and Ph.D. of Philosophy degree in any field such as agronomy, food technology, education, engineering, public administration, ophthalmology, or radiology.\n- First-professional: includes the fields of dentistry (DDS or DMD), medicine (MD), optometry (OD), osteopathic medicine (DO), pharmacy (DPharm or BPharm), podiatric medicine (DPM), veterinary medicine (DVM), chiropractic (DC or DCM), law (JD) and theological professions (MDiv, MHL).\n- Terminal degree: the highest degree in a field: example, M.Arch (architecture) and MFA (master of fine arts).","images":[],"dimensions":{"dpi":200,"height":2200,"width":1700}},{"index":21,"markdown":"|  | Full time | Part time | Total |\n| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |\n| Total number of instructional faculty | 1,608 | 145 | 1,753 |\n| Total number who are members of minority groups | 196 | 11 | 207 |\n| Total number who are women | 425 | 57 | 482 |\n| Total number who are men | 1,183 | 88 | 1,271 |\n| Total number who are non-resident aliens (international) | 64 | 4 | 68 |\n| Total number with doctorate, first professional, or other terminal degree | 1,443 | 104 | 1,547 |\n| Total number whose highest degree is a master's but not a terminal master's | 135 | 32 | 167 |\n| Total number who highest degree is a bachelor's | 25 | 9 | 34 |\n| Total number whose highest degree is unknown or other | 5 | 0 | 5 |\n\n# I2.

In the ratio calculations, EXCLUDE both faculty and students in stand-alone graduate or professional programs such as medicine, law, veterinary, dentistry, social work, business, or public health in which faculty teach virtually only graduate level students. Do not count undergraduate or graduate student teaching assistants as faculty.\n\nFall 2000 Student to Faculty ratio: $\\underline{11}$ to 1 .\n\n## I3. Undergraduate Class Size\n\nIn the table below. please use the following definitions to report information about the size of classes and class sections offered in the Fall 2000 term.\n\nClass Sections: A class section is an organized course offered for credit, identified by discipline and number, meeting at a stated time or times in a classroom or similar setting, and not a subsection such as a laboratory or discussion session. Undergraduate class sections are defined as any sections in which at least one degree-seeing undergraduate student is enrolled for credit. Exlude distance learning classes and noncredit classes and individual instruciton such as dissertation or thesis research, music instruction, or one-toone readings. Exlude students in independent study, co-operative programs, internships, foreign language taped tutor sessions, practicums, and all studnets in one-on-one classes. Each class section should be counted only once and should not be duplicated because of source catalog cross-listings.\n\nClass subsections: A class subsection includes any subsection of a course, such as laboratory, recitation, and discussion subsections that are supplementary in nature and are scheduled to meet separately from the lecture portion of the course. Undergraduate subsections are defined as any subsections of courses in which degree-seeking undergraduate students enrolled for credit. As above, exclude noncredit classes and individual instruction such as dissertation or thesis research, music instruction, or one-to-one readings. Each class subsection should be counted only once and should not be duplicated because of cross-listings.\n\nUsing the above definitions, please report for each of the following class-size intervals the number of class sections and class subsections offered in Fall 2000. For example, a lecture class with 800 students who met at another time in 40 separate labs with 20 students should be counted once in the \" $100+$ \" column in the class section column and 40 times under the \"20-29\" column of the class subsections table.","images":[],"dimensions":{"dpi":200,"height":2200,"width":1700}},{"index":22,"markdown":"# UNDERGRADUATE CLASS SIZE (provide numbers) \n\n|  | $2-9$ | $10-19$ | $20-29$ | $30-39$ | $40-49$ | $50-99$ | $100+$ | Total |\n| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |\n| Class <br> Sections <br> (Lectures) | 412 | 313 | 212 | 88 | 86 | 153 | 126 | 1,309 |\n| Class <br> Subsections <br> (Labs + Sections) | 804 | 1,117 | 388 | 99 | 28 | 38 | 20 | 2,494 |\n\n## J.
