For example, the federal loans average (row b) should only be the cumulative average of federal loans and the private loans average (row a) should only be the cumulative average of private loans.\n![img-2.jpeg](img-2.jpeg)\n\nAid to Undergraduate Degree-seeking Nonresident Aliens (Note: Report numbers and dollar amounts for the same academic year checked in item H1.)\n\nH6 Indicate your institution's policy regarding institutional scholarship and grant aid for undergraduate degreeseeking nonresident aliens:\n\n| H6 | Institutional need-based scholarship or grant aid is available |  |\n| :-- | :-- | :-- |\n| H6 | Institutional non-need-based scholarship or grant aid is available |  |\n| H6 | Institutional scholarship or grant aid is not available |  |\n\nH6 If institutional financial aid is available for undergraduate degree-seeking nonresident aliens, provide the number of undergraduate degree-seeking nonresident aliens who were awarded need-based or non-need-based aid:\n\nH6 Average dollar amount of institutional financial aid awarded to undergraduate degree-seeking nonresident aliens:\n\nH6 Total dollar amount of institutional financial aid awarded to undergraduate degree-seeking nonresident aliens:","images":[{"id":"img-2.jpeg","top_left_x":205,"top_left_y":479,"bottom_right_x":1302,"bottom_right_y":1458,"image_base64":null}],"dimensions":{"dpi":200,"height":2200,"width":1700}},{"index":20,"markdown":"H7 Check off all financial aid forms nonresident alien first-year financial aid applicants must submit:\nH7 Institution's own financial aid form\nH7 CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE\nH7 International Student's Financial Aid Application\nH7 International Student's Certification of Finances\nH7 Other (specify):\n\n# Process for First-Year/Freshman Students \n\nH8 Check off all financial aid forms domestic first-year (freshman) financial aid applicants must submit:\nH8 FAFSA\nX\nH8 Institution's own financial aid form\nH8 CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE\nX\nH8 State aid form\nH8 Noncustodial PROFILE\nH8 Business/Farm Supplement\nH8 Other (specify):\n\nH9 Indicate filing dates for first-year (freshman) students:\nH9 Priority date for filing required financial aid forms:\nH9 Deadline for filing required financial aid forms:\nNo deadline for filing required forms (applications processed on a rolling basis):\n\nH10 Indicate notification dates for first-year (freshman) students (answer a or b):\nH10 | a) Students notified on or about (date): | 4/1 |\n| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |\n| H10 |  | Yes | No |\n| H10 | b) Students notified on a rolling basis: | X |  |\n| H10 | If yes, starting date: |  |  |\n\nH11 Indicate reply dates:\nH11 Students must reply by (date):\nH11 or within\nweeks of notification.\n\n## Types of Aid Available\n\nPlease check off all types of aid available to undergraduates at your institution:\nH12 Loans\nH12 FEDERAL DIRECT STUDENT LOAN PROGRAM (DIRECT LOAN)\n\n| H12 | Direct Subsidized Stafford Loans | X |\n| :-- | :-- | :--: |\n| H12 | Direct Unsubsidized Stafford Loans | X |\n| H12 | Direct PLUS Loans | X |\n\nH12 Federal Perkins Loans\nX\nH12 Federal Nursing Loans\nH12 State Loans\nX\n\nH12 College/university loans from institutional funds\nH12 Other (specify):\nX\n\nH13 Scholarships and Grants\nH13 NEED-BASED:\nH13 Federal Pell\nX\nH13 SEOG\nX\nH13 State scholarships/grants\nX\nH13 Private scholarships\nX\nH13 College/university scholarship or grant aid from institutional funds\nX\n\nH13 United Negro College Fund\nH13 Federal Nursing Scholarship\nH13 Other (specify):\nX\n\nH14 Check off criteria used in awarding institutional aid.

Employees who are not considered full-time instructional faculty but who teach one or more non-clinical credit courses may be counted as part-time faculty.\nMinority faculty: includes faculty who designate themselves as Black, non-Hispanic; American Indian or Alaska Native; Asian, Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander, or Hispanic.\nDoctorate: includes such degrees as Doctor of Philosophy, Doctor of Education, Doctor of Juridical Science, and Doctor of Public Health in any field such as arts, sciences, education, engineering, business, and public administration.

Undergraduate class sections are defined as any sections in which at least one degree-seeking undergraduate student is enrolled for credit. Exclude distance learning classes and noncredit classes and individual instruction such as dissertation or thesis research, music instruction, or one-to-one readings. Exclude students in independent study, co-operative programs, internships, foreign language taped tutor sessions, practicums, and all students in one-on-one classes. Each class section should be counted only once and should not be duplicated because of course catalog cross-listings.\n\nClass Subsections: A class subsection includes any subsection of a course, such as laboratory, recitation, and discussion subsections that are supplementary in nature and are scheduled to meet separately from the lecture portion of the course. Undergraduate subsections are defined as any subsections of courses in which degree-seeking undergraduate students enrolled for credit. As above, exclude noncredit classes and individual instruction such as dissertation or thesis research, music instruction, or one-to-one readings. Each class subsection should be counted only once and should not be duplicated because of cross-listings.\nUsing the above definitions, please report for each of the following class-size intervals the number of class sections and class subsections offered in Fall 2016.
