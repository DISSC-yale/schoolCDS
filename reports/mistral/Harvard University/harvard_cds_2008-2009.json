Undergraduate class sections are defined as any sections in which at least one degree-seeking undergraduate student is enrolled for credit. Exclude distance learning classes and noncredit classes and individual instruction such as dissertation or thesis research, music instruction, or one-to-one readings. Exclude students in independent study, co-operative programs, internships, foreign language taped tutor sessions, practicums, and all students in one-on-one classes. Each class section should be counted only once and should not be duplicated because of course catalog cross-listings.\n\nClass Subsections: A class subsection includes any subsection of a course, such as laboratory, recitation, and discussion subsections that are supplementary in nature and are scheduled to meet separately from the lecture portion of the course. Undergraduate subsections are defined as any subsections of courses in which degree-seeking undergraduate students enrolled for credit. As above, exclude noncredit classes and individual instruction such as dissertation or thesis research, music instruction, or one-to-one readings. Each class subsection should be counted only once and should not be duplicated because of cross-listings.\nUsing the above definitions, please report for each of the following class-size intervals the number of class sections and class subsections offered in Fall 2008. For example, a lecture class with 800 students who met at another time in 40 separate labs with 20 students should be counted once in the \"100+\" column in the class section column and 40 times under the \"20-29\" column of the class subsections table.\n\n## 13\n\nNumber of Class Sections with Undergraduates Enrolled\n\n| 13 | Undergraduate Class Size (provide numbers) |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |\n|  | CLASS | 2-9 | 10-19 | 20-29 | 30-39 | 40-49 | 50-99 | 100+ | Total |\n| 13 | SECTIONS | 499 | 486 | 116 | 51 | 22 | 60 | 44 | 1278 |\n| 13 | CLASS SUB- | 2-9 | 10-19 | 20-29 | 30-39 | 40-49 | 50-99 | 100+ | Total |\n| 13 | SECTIONS |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | 0 |","images":[],"dimensions":{"dpi":200,"height":2200,"width":1700}},{"index":23,"markdown":"# J. DEGREES CONFERRED \n\nJ1 Degrees conferred between July 1, 2007 and June 30, 2008\nJ1 For each of the following discipline areas, provide the percentage of diplomas/certificates, associate, and bachelor's degrees awarded. To determine the percentage, use majors, not headcount (e.g., students with one degree but a double major will be represented twice). Calculate the percentage from your institution's IPEDS Completions by using the sum of 1st and 2nd majors for each CIP code as the numerator and the sum of the Grand Total by 1st Majors and the Grand Total by 2nd major as the denominator. If you prefer, you can compute the percentages using 1st majors only.\n\n| J1 | Category | Diploma/ <br> Certificates | Associate | Bachelor's | CIP 2000 Categories to <br> Include |\n| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |\n| J1 | Agriculture |  |  | 0.00\\% | 1 |\n| J1 | Natural resources/environmental science |  |  | 1.22\\% | 3 |\n| J1 | Architecture |  |  | 0.00\\% | 4 |\n| J1 | Area and ethnic studies |  |  | 2.55\\% | 5 |\n| J1 | Communications/journalism |  |  | 0.00\\% | 9 |\n| J1 | Communication technologies |  |  | 0.00\\% | 10 |\n| J1 | Computer and information sciences |  |  | 1.33\\% | 11 |\n| J1 | Personal and culinary services |  |  | 0.00\\% | 12 |\n| J1 | Education |  |  | 0.00\\% | 13 |\n| J1 | Engineering |  |  | 1.92\\% | 14 |\n| J1 | Engineering technologies |  |  | 0.00\\% | 15 |\n| J1 | Foreign languages and literature |  |  | 4.59\\% | 16 |\n| J1 | Family and consumer sciences |  |  | 0.00\\% | 19 |\n| J1 | Law/legal studies |  |  | 0.00\\% | 22 |\n| J1 | English |  |  | 5.28\\% | 23 |\n| J1 | Liberal arts/general studies |  |  | 0.81\\% | 24 |\n| J1 | Library science |  |  | 0.00\\% | 25 |\n| J1 | Biological/life sciences |  |  | 12.59\\% | 26 |\n| J1 | Mathematics |  |  | 4.47\\% | 27 |\n| J1 | Military science and technologies |  |  | 0.00\\% | 29 |\n| J1 | Interdisciplinary studies |  |  | 0.00\\% | 30 |\n| J1 | Parks and recreation |  |  | 0.00\\% | 31 |\n| J1 | Philosophy and religious studies |  |  | 1.28\\% | 38 |\n| J1 | Theology and religious vocations |  |  | 0.00\\% | 39 |\n| J1 | Physical sciences |  |  | 5.11\\% | 40 |\n| J1 | Science technologies |  |  | 0.00\\% | 41 |\n| J1 | Psychology |  |  | 6.50\\% | 42 |\n| J1 | Security and protective services |  |  | 0.00\\% | 43 |\n| J1 | Public administration and social services |  |  | 0.00\\% | 44 |\n| J1 | Social sciences |  |  | 40.92\\% | 45 |\n| J1 | Construction trades |  |  | 0.00\\% | 46 |\n| J1 | Mechanic and repair technologies |  |  | 0.00\\% | 47 |\n| J1 | Precision production |  |  | 0.00\\% | 48 |\n| J1 | Transportation and materials moving |  |  | 0.00\\% | 49 |\n| J1 | Visual and performing arts |  |  | 3.60\\% | 50 |\n| J1 | Health professions and related sciences |  |  | 0.00\\% | 51 |\n| J1 | Business/marketing |  |  | 0.00\\% | 52 |\n| J1 | History |  |  | 7.84\\% | 54 |\n| J1 | Other |  |  |  |  |\n| J1 | TOTAL (should $=100 \\%$ ) | 0.00\\% | 0.00\\% | 100.0\\% |  |","images":[],"dimensions":{"dpi":200,"height":2200,"width":1700}}],"model":"mistral-ocr-2503-completion","usage_info":{"pages_processed":24,"doc_size_bytes":59071}}
