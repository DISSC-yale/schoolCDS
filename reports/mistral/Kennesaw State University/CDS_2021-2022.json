Student loans co-signed by a parent are assumed to be the responsibility of the student and should be included.\n\nInstitutional scholarships and grants: Endowed scholarships, annual gifts and tuition funded grants for which the institution determines the recipient.\n\nFinancial need: As determined by your institution using the federal methodology and/or your institution's own standards.\n\nNeed-based aid: College-funded or college-administered award from institutional, state, federal, or other sources for which a student must have financial need to qualify. This includes both institutional and non-institutional student aid (grants, jobs, and loans).\n\nNeed-based scholarship or grant aid: Scholarships and grants from institutional, state, federal, or other sources for which a student must have financial need to qualify.\nNeed-based self-help aid: Loans and jobs from institutional, state, federal, or other sources for which a student must demonstrate financial need to qualify.\nNon-need-based scholarship or grant aid: Scholarships and grants, gifts, or merit-based aid from institutional, state, federal, or other sources (including unrestricted funds or gifts and endowment income) awarded solely on the basis of academic achievement, merit, or any other non-need-based reason.
