Each class subsection should be counted only once and should not be duplicated because of cross-listings.\n\nUsing the above definitions, please report for each of the following class-size intervals the number of class sections and class subsections offered in Fall 1999. For example, a lecture class with 800 students who met at another time in 40 separate labs with 20 students should be counted once in the \" $100+$ \" column in the class section column and 40 times under the \"20-29\" column of the class subsections table.\n\n# Number of Class Sections with Undergraduates Enrolled. \n\n## Undergraduate Class Size (provide numbers)\n\n|  | Less than $10$ | $10-19$ | $20-29$ | $30-39$ | $40-49$ | $50-99$ | $100+$ | Total |\n| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |\n| CLASS <br> SECTIONS | Not Available | Not Available | Not <br> Available | Not <br> Available | Not <br> Available | Not <br> Available | Not <br> Ava <br> ilab <br> le | Not <br> Avail <br> able |\n\n\n|  | Less than $10$ | $10-19$ | $20-29$ | $30-39$ | $40-49$ | $50-99$ | $100+$ | Total |\n| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |\n| CLASS | Not | Not | Not | Not | Not | Not | Not |\n| SUB- <br> SECTIONS | Available | Available | Availab le | Avail <br> able | Availab le | Availab le | Avail <br> able | Avail <br> able |","images":[],"dimensions":{"dpi":200,"height":2200,"width":1700}},{"index":25,"markdown":"# J.
