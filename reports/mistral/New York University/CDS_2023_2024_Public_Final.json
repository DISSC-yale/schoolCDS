Student loans co-signed by a parent are assumed to be the responsibility of the student and should be included.\n\nInstitutional scholarships and grants: Endowed scholarships, annual gifts and tuition funded grants for which the institution determines the recipient.\n\nFinancial need: As determined by your institution using the federal methodology and/or your institution's own standards.\n\nNeed-based aid: College-funded or college-administered award from institutional, state, federal, or other sources for which a student must have financial need to qualify. This includes both institutional and non-institutional student aid (grants, jobs, and loans).\n\nNeed-based scholarship or grant aid: Scholarships and grants from institutional, state, federal, or other sources for which a student must have financial need to qualify.\n\nNeed-based self-help aid: Loans and jobs from institutional, state, federal, or other sources for which a student must demonstrate financial need to qualify.\n\nNon-need-based scholarship or grant aid: Scholarships and grants, gifts, or merit-based aid from institutional, state, federal, or other sources (including unrestricted funds or gifts and endowment income) awarded solely on the basis of academic achievement, merit, or any other non-need-based reason. When reporting questions H 1 and H 2 , non-need-based aid that is used to meet need should be counted as need-based aid.\n\nNote: Suggested order of precedence for counting non-need money as need-based:\n\n1. Non-need institutional grants\n2. Non-need tuition waivers\n3. Non-need athletic awards\n4. Non-need federal grants\n5. Non-need state grants\n\nNon-need-based self-help aid: Loans and jobs from institutional, state, or other sources for which a student need not demonstrate financial need to qualify.\n\nPrivate student loans: A nonfederal loan made by a lender such as a bank, credit union or private lender used to pay for up to the annual cost of education, less any financial aid received.\n\nExternal scholarships and grants: Scholarships and grants received from outside (private) sources that students bring with them (e.g., Kiwanis, National Merit scholarships). The institution may process paperwork to receive the dollars, but it has no role in determining the recipient or the dollar amount awarded.\n\nWork study and employment: Federal and state work study aid, and any employment packaged by your institution in financial aid awards.\n\n## H1.

Undergraduate class sections are defined as any sections in which at least one degree-seeking undergraduate student is enrolled for credit. Exclude distance learning classes and noncredit classes and individual instruction such as dissertation or thesis research, music instruction, or one-to-one readings. Exclude students in independent study, co-operative programs, internships, foreign language taped tutor sessions, practicums, and all students in one-on-one classes. Each class section should be counted only once and should not be duplicated because of course catalog cross-listings.\n\nClass Subsections: A class subsection includes any subsection of a course, such as laboratory, recitation, and discussion subsections that are supplementary in nature and are scheduled to meet separately from the lecture portion of the course. Undergraduate subsections are defined as any subsections of courses in which degree-seeking undergraduate students enrolled for credit. As above, exclude noncredit classes and individual instruction such as dissertation or thesis research, music instruction, or one-to-one readings. Each class subsection should be counted only once and should not be duplicated because of cross-listings.\n\nUsing the above definitions, please report for each of the following class-size intervals the number of class sections and class subsections offered in Fall 2023. For example, a lecture class with 800 students who met at another time in 40 separate labs with 20 students should be counted once in the \"100+\" column in the class section column and 40 times under the \"20-29\" column of the class subsections table.\n\n| Number of class sections with undergraduates enrolled - <br> Undergraduate Class Size (provide numbers) | Class <br> Sections | Class Sub- <br> Sections |\n| :--: | :--: | :--: |\n|  | 789 | 563 |\n| $10-19$ | 2262 | 705 |\n| $20-29$ | 1009 | 577 |\n| $30-39$ | 393 | 282 |\n| $40-49$ | 251 | 37 |\n| $50-59$ | 371 | 13 |\n| $100+$ | 113 | 5 |\n| Total | 5188 | 2182 |\n\n## END OF SECTION I","images":[],"dimensions":{"dpi":200,"height":2201,"width":1700}},{"index":41,"markdown":"# J. DISCIPLINARY AREAS of DEGREES CONFERRED \n\nDegrees conferred between July 1, 2022 and June 30, 2023.\nFor each of the following discipline areas, provide the percentage of diplomas/certificates, associate, and bachelor's degrees awarded. To determine the percentage, use majors, not headcount (e.g., students with one degree but a double major will be represented twice). Calculate the percentage from your institution's IPEDS Completions by using the sum of $1^{\\text {st }}$ and $2^{\\text {nd }}$ majors for each CIP code as the numerator and the sum of the Grand Total by 1st Majors and the Grand Total by $2^{\\text {nd }}$ major as the denominator. If you prefer, you can compute the percentages using $1^{\\text {st }}$ majors only.\n\n| Category | Diploma/ Certificates | Associate | Bachelor's | CIP 2020 Categories to Include |\n| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |\n| Agriculture |  |  |  | 1 |\n| Natural resources and conservation |  |  |  | 3 |\n| Architecture |  |  |  | 4 |\n| Area, ethnic, and gender studies |  |  | 0.3 | 5 |\n| Communication/journalism |  |  | 5.4 | 9 |\n| Communication technologies |  |  | 0.1 | 10 |\n| Computer and information sciences |  | 2.3 | 8.4 | 11 |\n| Personal and culinary services |  |  |  | 12 |\n| Education |  |  | 1.2 | 13 |\n| Engineering |  |  | 4.0 | 14 |\n| Engineering technologies |  |  | 1.0 | 15 |\n| Foreign languages, literatures, and linguistics |  |  | 0.4 | 16 |\n| Family and consumer sciences |  |  |  | 19 |\n| Law/legal studies |  |  |  | 22 |\n| English |  |  | 1.2 | 23 |\n| Liberal arts/general studies |  | 25.0 | 7.7 | 24 |\n| Library science |  |  |  | 25 |\n| Biological/life sciences |  |  | 3.5 | 26 |\n| Mathematics and statistics |  |  | 5.8 | 27 |\n| Military science and military technologies |  |  |  | 28 and 29 |\n| Interdisciplinary studies |  |  | 1.8 | 30 |\n| Parks and recreation |  |  |  | 31 |\n| Philosophy and religious studies |  |  | 0.8 | 38 |\n| Theology and religious vocations |  |  |  | 39 |\n| Physical sciences |  |  | 1.2 | 40 |\n| Science technologies |  |  |  | 41 |\n| Psychology |  |  | 6.3 | 42 |\n| Homeland Security, law enforcement, firefighting, and protective services |  |  |  | 43 |\n| Public administration and social services |  |  | 0.5 | 44 |\n| Social sciences |  |  | 13.6 | 45 |\n| Construction trades |  |  |  | 46 |\n| Mechanic and repair technologies |  |  |  | 47 |\n| Precision production |  |  |  | 48 |\n| Transportation and materials moving |  |  |  | 49 |\n| Visual and performing arts |  |  | 16.6 | 50 |\n| Health professions and related programs |  | 67.1 | 7.4 | 51 |\n| Business/marketing |  | 5.7 | 12.4 | 52 |\n| History |  |  | 0.8 | 54 |\n| Other |  |  |  |  |","images":[],"dimensions":{"dpi":200,"height":2201,"width":1700}}],"model":"mistral-ocr-2503-completion","usage_info":{"pages_processed":42,"doc_size_bytes":776792}}
