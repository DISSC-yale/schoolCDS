Instructional Faculty is defined as those members of the instructional-research staff whose major regular assignment is instruction, including those with released time for research. Institutions are asked to EXCLUDE:\n(a) instructional faculty in preclinical and clinical medicine\n(b) administrative officers with titles such as dean of students, librarian, registrar, coach, and the like, even though they may devote part of their time to classroom instruction and may have faculty status,\n(c) undergraduate or graduate students who assist in the instruction of courses, but have titles such as teaching assistant, teaching fellow, and the like\n(d) faculty on leave without pay, and\n(e) replacement faculty for faculty on sabbatical leave.\n\nFull-time: faculty employed on a full-time basis\nPart-time: faculty teaching less than two semesters, three quarters, two trimesters, or two four-month sessions. Also includes adjuncts and part-time instructors.\nMinority faculty: includes faculty who designate themselves as black, non-Hispanic; American Indian or Alaskan native; Asian or Pacific Islander; or Hispanic.\nDoctorate: includes such degrees as Doctor of Education, Doctor of Juridical Science, Doctor of Public Health, and Doctor of Philosophy degree in any field such as agronomy, food technology, education, engineering, public administration, ophthalmology, or radiology.\nFirst-professional: includes the fields of dentistry (DDS or DMD), medicine (MD), optometry (OD), osteopathic medicine (DO), pharmacy (DPharm or BPharm), podiatric medicine (DPM), veterinary medicine (DVM), chiropractic (DC or DCM), law (JD) and theological professions (MDiv, MHL).\nTerminal degree: the highest degree in a field: example, M.

Undergraduate class sections are defined as any sections in which at least one degree-seeking undergraduate student is enrolled for credit. Exclude distance learning classes and noncredit classes and individual instruction such as dissertation or thesis research, music instruction, or one-to-one readings. Exclude students in independent study, co-operative programs, internships, foreign language taped tutor sessions, practicums, and all students in one-on-one classes. Each class section should be counted only once and should not be duplicated because of course catalog crosslistings.\nClass Subsections: A class subsection includes any subsection of a course, such as laboratory, recitation, and discussion subsections that are supplementary in nature and are scheduled to meet separately from the lecture portion of the course. Undergraduate subsections are defined as any subsections of courses in which degree-seeking undergraduate students enrolled for credit. As above, exclude noncredit classes and individual instruction such as dissertation or thesis research, music instruction, or one-to-one readings. Each class subsection should be counted only once and should not be duplicated because of cross-listings.\nUsing the above definitions, please report for each of the following class-size intervals the number of class sections and class subsections offered in Fall 2002. For example, a lecture class with 800 students who met at another time in 40 separate labs with 20 students should be counted once in the \" $100+$ \" column in the class section column and 40 times under the \"20-29\" column of the class subsections table.\n\n## Number of Class Sections with Undergraduates Enrolled\n\nUndergraduate Class Size (provide numbers)\n\n| CLASS <br> SECTIONS | 2-9 | 10-19 | 20-29 | 30-39 | 40-49 | 50-99 | 100+ | Total |\n| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |\n|  | 197 | 607 | 955 | 558 | 302 | 255 | 35 | 2909 |\n| CLASS |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |","images":[],"dimensions":{"dpi":200,"height":2200,"width":1700}},{"index":27,"markdown":"| SUB- <br> SECTIONS | 2-9 | 10-19 | 20-29 | 30-39 | 40-49 | 50-99 | 100+ | Total |\n| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |\n|  | 95 | 378 | 299 | 79 | 53 | 50 | 20 | 974 |","images":[],"dimensions":{"dpi":200,"height":2200,"width":1700}},{"index":28,"markdown":"# J.
