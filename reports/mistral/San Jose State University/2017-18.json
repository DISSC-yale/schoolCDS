For example, the federal loans average (row b) should only be the cumulative average of federal loans and the private loans average (row a) should only be the cumulative average of private loans.\n![img-2.jpeg](img-2.jpeg)\n\nAid to Undergraduate Degree-seeking Nonresident Aliens (Note: Report numbers and dollar amounts for the same academic year checked in item H1.)\n\nH6 Indicate your institution's policy regarding institutional scholarship and grant aid for undergraduate degreeseeking nonresident aliens:\n\n| H6 | Institutional need-based scholarship or grant aid is available | $x$ |\n| :-- | :-- | :-- |\n| H6 | Institutional non-need-based scholarship or grant aid is available | $x$ |\n| H6 | Institutional scholarship or grant aid is not available |  |\n\nH6 If institutional financial aid is available for undergraduate degree-seeking nonresident aliens, provide the number of undergraduate degree-seeking nonresident aliens who were awarded need-based or non-need-based aid:\n\nH6 Average dollar amount of institutional financial aid awarded to undergraduate degree-seeking nonresident aliens:\n$\\$ 9,805$\n$\\$ 9,805$\nH6 Total dollar amount of institutional financial aid awarded to undergraduate degree-seeking nonresident aliens:\n$\\$ 4,333,625$","images":[{"id":"img-2.jpeg","top_left_x":171,"top_left_y":479,"bottom_right_x":1302,"bottom_right_y":1458,"image_base64":null}],"dimensions":{"dpi":200,"height":2200,"width":1700}},{"index":22,"markdown":"H7 Check off all financial aid forms nonresident alien first-year financial aid applicants must submit:\n\n| H7 | Institution's own financial aid form | $x$ |\n| :-- | :-- | :--: |\n| H7 | CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE |  |\n| H7 | International Student's Financial Aid Application |  |\n| H7 | International Student's Certification of Finances |  |\n| H7 | Other (specify): |  |\n\n# Process for First-Year/Freshman Students \n\nH8 Check off all financial aid forms domestic first-year (freshman) financial aid applicants must submit:\n\n| H8 | FAFSA | $x$ |\n| :-- | :-- | :--: |\n| H8 | Institution's own financial aid form |  |\n| H8 | CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE |  |\n| H8 | State aid form | $x$ |\n| H8 | Noncustodial PROFILE |  |\n| H8 | Business/Farm Supplement |  |\n| H8 | Other (specify): |  |\n\nH9 indicate filing dates for first-year (freshman) students:\n\n| H9 | Priority date for filing required financial aid forms: | $3 / 2$ |\n| :-- | :-- | --: |\n| H9 | Deadline for filing required financial aid forms: | $4 / 28$ |\n| No deadline for filing required forms (applications processed on a <br> rolling basis): |  |  |\n\nH10 Indicate notification dates for first-year (freshman) students (answer a or b):\n\n| H10 | 4 | Students notified on or about (date): |  |\n| :-- | :-- | :--: | :--: |\n| H10 |  | Yes | No |\n| H10 | 6 | Students notified on a rolling basis: | $x$ |\n| H10 |  | If yes, starting date: | $3 / 1$ |\n\nH11 Indicate reply dates:\n\n| H11 | Students must reply by (date): |  |\n| :-- | :-- | :--: |\n| H11 | or within | weeks of notification. |\n\n## Types of Aid Available\n\nPlease check off all types of aid available to undergraduates at your institution:\nH12 Loans\nH12 FEDERAL DIRECT STUDENT LOAN PROGRAM (DIRECT LOAN)\n\n| H12 | Direct Subsidized Stafford Loans | $x$ |\n| :-- | :-- | :--: |\n| H12 | Direct Unsubsidized Stafford Loans | $x$ |\n| H12 | Direct PLUS Loans | $x$ |\n| H12 | Federal Perkins Loans | $x$ |\n| H12 | Federal Nursing Loans |  |\n| H12 | State Loans | $x$ |\n| H12 | College/university loans from institutional funds |  |\n| H12 | Other (specify): |  |\n\nH13 Scholarships and Grants\nH13 NEED-BASED:\nH13 Federal Pell\n$\\mathrm{H13} \\quad$ SEOG\nH13 State scholarships/grants\nH13 Private scholarships\nH13 College/university scholarship or grant aid from institutional funds\nH13 United Negro College Fund\nH13 Federal Nursing Scholarship\nH13 Other (specify):\nH14 Check off criteria used in awarding institutional aid.

INSTRUCTIONAL FACULTY AND CLASS SIZE \n\nPlease report the number of instructional faculty members in each category for Fall 2017. Include faculty who are on your institution's payroll on the census date your institution uses for\n11 IPEES/AAUP.\nThe following definition of full-time instructional faculty is used by the American Association of University Professors (AAUP) in its annual Faculty Compensation Survey (the part time definitions are not used by AAUP). Instructional Faculty is defined as those members of the instructional-research staff whose major regular assignment is instruction, including those with released time for research. Use the chart below to determine inclusions and exclusions:\n\n|  |  | Full-time | Part-time |\n| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |\n|  | (a) instructional faculty in preclinical and clinical medicine, faculty who are not paid (e.g., those who donate their services or are in the military), or research-only faculty, postdoctoral fellows, or pre-doctoral fellows | Exclude | Include only if they teach one or more nonclinical credit courses |\n|  | (b) administrative officers with titles such as dean of students, librarian, registrar, coach, and the like, even though they may devote part of their time to classroom instruction and may have faculty status | Exclude | Include if they teach one or more nonclinical credit courses |\n|  | (c) other administrators/staff who teach one or more non-clinical credit courses even though they do not have faculty status | Exclude | Include |\n|  | (d) undergraduate or graduate students who assist in the instruction of courses, but have titles such as teaching assistant, teaching fellow, and the like | Exclude | Exclude |\n|  | (e) faculty on sabbatical or leave with pay | Include | Exclude |\n|  | (f) faculty on leave without pay | Exclude | Exclude |\n|  | (g) replacement faculty for faculty on sabbatical leave or leave with pay | Exclude | Include |\n\nFull-time instructional faculty: faculty employed on a full-time basis for instruction (including those with released time for research)\nPart-time instructional faculty: Adjuncts and other instructors being paid solely for part-time classroom instruction. Also includes full-time faculty teaching less than two semesters, three quarters, two trimesters, or two four-month sessions. Employees who are not considered full-time instructional faculty but who teach one or more non-clinical credit courses may be counted as part-time faculty.\nMinority faculty: includes faculty who designate themselves as Black, non-Hispanic; American Indian or Alaska Native; Asian, Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander, or Hispanic.\nDoctorate: includes such degrees as Doctor of Philosophy, Doctor of Education, Doctor of Juridical Science, and Doctor of Public Health in any field such as arts, sciences, education, engineering, business, and public administration. Also includes terminal degrees formerly designated as 'first professional,' including dentistry (DDS or DMD), medicine (MD), optometry (OD), osteopathic medicine (DO), pharmacy (DPharm or BPharm), podiatric medicine (DPM), veterinary medicine (DVM), chiropractic (DC or DCM), or law (JD).\nTerminal degree: the highest degree in a field; example, M. Arch (architecture) and MFA (master of fine arts).\n![img-3.jpeg](img-3.jpeg)\n\n## I2 Student to Faculty Ratio\n\nReport the Fall 2017 ratio of full-time equivalent students (full-time plus 1/3 part time) to full-time equivalent instructional faculty (full time plus 1/3 part time). In the ratio calculations, exclude both faculty and students in stand-alone graduate or professional programs such as medicine, law, veterinary, dentistry, social work, business, or public health in which faculty teach virtually only graduate-level students.

Undergraduate class sections are defined as any sections in which at least one degree-seeking undergraduate student is enrolled for credit. Exclude distance learning classes and noncredit classes and individual instruction such as dissertation or thesis research, music instruction, or one-to-one readings. Exclude students in independent study, co-operative programs, internships, foreign language taped tutor sessions, practicums, and all students in one-on-one classes. Each class section should be counted only once and should not be duplicated because of course catalog cross-listings.\n\nClass Subsections: A class subsection includes any subsection of a course, such as laboratory, recitation, and discussion subsections that are supplementary in nature and are scheduled to meet separately from the lecture portion of the course. Undergraduate subsections are defined as any subsections of courses in which degree-seeking undergraduate students enrolled for credit. As above, exclude noncredit classes and individual instruction such as dissertation or thesis research, music instruction, or one-to-one readings. Each class subsection should be counted only once and should not be duplicated because of cross-listings.\nUsing the above definitions, please report for each of the following class-size intervals the number of class sections and class subsections offered in Fall 2017.
