Room and board is defined as double occupancy and 19 meals per week or the maximum meal plan. Required fees include only charges that all full-time students must pay that are not included in tuition (e.g., registration, health, or activity fees.) Do not include optional fees (e.g., parking, laboratory use).\n\n|  | FIRST-YEAR | UNDERGRADUATES |\n| :--: | :--: | :--: |\n| Tuition | \\$38,700 | \\$38,700 |\n| Required Fees | \\$438 | \\$501 |\n| Room and Board | \\$11,876 | \\$11,876 |\n| Room Only | \\$6,700 | \\$6,700 |\n| Board Only | \\$5,176 | \\$5,176 |\n\nComprehensive tuition and room and board fee (if your college cannot provide separate tuition and room and board fees):\nOther:\n\nG2.

Students will still be expected to contribute toward their own expenses from their summer income, parttime work during the school year, and their own savings.\n\nTuition Charges Covered for Parents with Income Below \\$100,000\nFor parents with total annual income below $\\$ 100,000$ and typical assets for this income range, the expected parent contribution will be low enough to ensure that all tuition charges are covered with need-based scholarship, federal and state grants, and/or outside scholarship funds.\n\nFamilies with incomes at higher levels (typically up to $\\$ 200,000$ ) may also qualify for assistance, especially if more than one family member is enrolled in college. We encourage any family concerned about the ability to pay for a Stanford education to complete the application process. If we are not able to offer need-based scholarship funds we will recommend available loan programs.\n\nFor details please refer to http://financialaid.stanford.edu.\n\n# I.

Undergraduate class sections are defined as any sections in which at least one degree-seeking undergraduate student is enrolled for credit. Exclude distance learning classes and noncredit classes and individual instruction such as dissertation or thesis research, music instruction, or one-toone readings. Exclude students in independent study, co-operative programs, internships, foreign language taped tutor sessions, practicums, and all students in one-on-one classes. Each class section should be counted only once and should not be duplicated because of course catalog cross-listings.\n\nClass Subsections: A class subsection includes any subsection of a course, such as laboratory, recitation, and discussion subsections that are supplementary in nature and are scheduled to meet separately from the lecture portion of the course. Undergraduate subsections are defined as any subsections of courses in which degree-seeking undergraduate students enrolled for credit. As above, exclude noncredit classes and individual instruction such as dissertation or thesis research, music instruction, or one-toone readings.
