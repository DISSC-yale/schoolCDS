The combined goal of this collaboration is to improve the quality and accuracy of information provided to all involved in a student's transition into higher education, as well as to reduce the reporting burden on data providers.\n\nThis goal is attained by the development of clear, standard data items and definitions in order to determine a specific cohort relevant to each item. Data items and definitions used by the U.S. Department of Education in its higher education surveys often serve as a guide in the continued development of the CDS.

Undergraduate full-time tuition, required fees, room and board\n\nList the typical tuition, required fees, and room and board for a full-time undergraduate student for the FULL 2010-2011 academic year.

Room and board is defined as double occupancy and 19 meals per week or the maximum meal plan. Required fees include only charges that all full-time students must pay that are not included in tuition (e.g., registration, health, or activity fees.) Do not include optional fees (e.g., parking, laboratory use).\n\n|  | FIRST-YEAR | UNDERGRADUATES |\n| :--: | :--: | :--: |\n| Tuition | \\$40,050 | \\$40,050 |\n| Required Fees | \\$957 | \\$519 |\n| Room and Board | \\$12,291 | \\$12,291 |\n| Room Only |  |  |\n| Board Only |  |  |\n\nComprehensive tuition and room and board fee (if your college cannot provide separate tuition and room and board fees):\nOther:\n\nG2.

If you institution has recently implemented any major financial aid policy, program or initiative to make your institution more affordable to incoming students, such as replacing loans with grants, or waiving costs for families below a certain income, please provide details below:\n\"Zero Parent Contribution for Parents with Income Below \\$60,000\nFor parents with total annual income below $\\$ 60,000$ and typical assets for this income range, Stanford will not expect a parent contribution toward educational costs. Students will still be expected to contribute toward their own expenses from their summer income, parttime work during the school year, and their own savings.\n\nTuition Charges Covered for Parents with Income Below \\$100,000\nFor parents with total annual income below $\\$ 100,000$ and typical assets for this income range, the expected parent contribution will be low enough to ensure that all tuition charges are covered with need-based scholarship, federal and state grants, and/or outside scholarship funds.\n\nFamilies with incomes at higher levels (typically up to $\\$ 200,000$ ) may also qualify for assistance, especially if more than one family member is enrolled in college. We encourage any family concerned about the ability to pay for a Stanford education to complete the application process. If we are not able to offer need-based scholarship funds we will recommend available loan programs.\n\nFor details please refer to http://financialaid.stanford.edu.\n\n# I.

Undergraduate Class Size \n\nIn the table below, please use the following definitions to report information about the size of classes and class sections offered in the Fall 2011 term.\n\nClass Sections: A class section is an organized course offered for credit, identified by discipline and number, meeting at a stated time or times in a classroom or similar setting, and not a subsection such as a laboratory or discussion session. Undergraduate class sections are defined as any sections in which at least one degree-seeking undergraduate student is enrolled for credit. Exclude distance learning classes and noncredit classes and individual instruction such as dissertation or thesis research, music instruction, or one-toone readings. Exclude students in independent study, co-operative programs, internships, foreign language taped tutor sessions, practicums, and all students in one-on-one classes. Each class section should be counted only once and should not be duplicated because of course catalog cross-listings.\n\nClass Subsections: A class subsection includes any subsection of a course, such as laboratory, recitation, and discussion subsections that are supplementary in nature and are scheduled to meet separately from the lecture portion of the course. Undergraduate subsections are defined as any subsections of courses in which degree-seeking undergraduate students enrolled for credit. As above, exclude noncredit classes and individual instruction such as dissertation or thesis research, music instruction, or one-toone readings.
