The combined goal of this collaboration is to improve the quality and accuracy of information provided to all involved in a student's transition into higher education, as well as to reduce the reporting burden on data providers.\n\nThis goal is attained by the development of clear, standard data items and definitions in order to determine a specific cohort relevant to each item. Data items and definitions used by the U.S. Department of Education in its higher education surveys often serve as a guide in the continued development of the CDS. Common Data Set items undergo broad review by the CDS Advisory Board as well as by data providers representing secondary schools and two- and four-year colleges.\n\n## General information\n\nEnrollment and persistence\nFirst-time, first-year freshman admission\nTransfer admission\nAcademic offerings and policies\nStudent life\nAnnual expenses\nFinancial aid\nInstructional faculty and class size\nDegrees conferred\nUp-to-date admission information also is available through the Undergraduate\nAdmission website.\n\n## A.
