Undergraduate class sections are defined as any sections in which at least one degree-seeking undergraduate student is enrolled for credit. Exclude distance learning classes and noncredit classes and individual instruction such as dissertation or thesis research, music instruction, or one-to-one readings. Exclude students in independent study, co-operative programs, internships, foreign language taped tutor sessions, practicums, and all students in one-on-one classes. Each class section should be counted only once and should not be duplicated because of course catalog cross-listings.\n\nClass Subsections: A class subsection includes any subsection of a course, such as laboratory, recitation, and discussion subsections that are supplementary in nature and are scheduled to meet separately from the lecture portion of the course. Undergraduate subsections are defined as any subsections of courses in which degree-seeking undergraduate students enrolled for credit. As above, exclude noncredit classes and individual instruction such as dissertation or thesis research, music instruction, or one-to-one readings. Each class subsection should be counted only once and should not be duplicated because of cross-listings.\n\nUsing the above definitions, please report for each of the following class-size intervals the number of class sections and class subsections offered in Fall 2017. For example, a lecture class with 800 students who met at another time in 40 separate labs with 20 students should be counted once in the \"100+\" column in the class section column and 40 times under the \"20-29\" column of the class subsections table.\n\n## I3\n\nNumber of Class Sections with Undergraduates Enrolled\n\n| 13 | Undergraduate Class Size (provide numbers) |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |\n|  | CLASS <br> SECTIONS | 2-9 | 10-19 | 20-29 | 30-39 | 40-49 | 50-99 | 100+ | Total |\n| 13 |  | 588 | 558 | 185 | 84 | 65 | 121 | 76 | 1677 |\n| 13 | CLASS SUBSECTIONS | 2-9 | 10-19 | 20-29 | 30-39 | 40-49 | 50-99 | 100+ | Total |\n| 13 |  | 258 | 212 | 29 | 2 | 2 | 0 | 1 | 504 |","images":[],"dimensions":{"dpi":200,"height":2200,"width":1700}},{"index":27,"markdown":"# J.
