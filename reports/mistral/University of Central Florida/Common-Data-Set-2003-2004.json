Undergraduate subsections are defined as any subsections of courses in which degree-seeking undergraduate students are enrolled for credit. As above, exclude noncredit classes and individual instruction such as dissertation or thesis research, music instruction, or one-to-one readings. Each class subsection should be counted only once and should not be duplicated because of cross-listings.\n\nUsing the above definitions, please report for each of the following class-size intervals the number of class sections and class subsections offered in Fall 2003. For example, a lecture class with 800 students who met at another time in 40 separate labs with 20 students should be counted once in the \"100+\" column in the class section column and 40 times under the \"20-29\" column of the class subsections table.\n\n# Number of Class Sections with Undergraduates Enrolled. \n\nUndergraduate Class Size (provide numbers)\n\n|  | $2-9$ | $10-19$ | $20-29$ | $30-39$ | $40-49$ | $50-99$ | $100+$ | Total |\n| :-- | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |\n| Class <br> Sections | 467 | 515 | 765 | 463 | 341 | 448 | 158 | 3157 |\n|  | $2-9$ | $10-19$ | $20-29$ | $30-39$ | $40-49$ | $50-99$ | $100+$ | Total |\n| Class Sub- <br> sections | 81 | 173 | 168 | 200 | 43 | 36 | 0 | 701 |\n\n## J.
