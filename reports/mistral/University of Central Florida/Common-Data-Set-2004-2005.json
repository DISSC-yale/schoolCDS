Student to Faculty Ratio \n\nReport the Fall 2004 ratio of full-time equivalent students (full-time plus $1 / 3$ part time) to full-time equivalent instructional faculty (full time plus $1 / 3$ part time). In the ratio calculations, exclude both faculty and students in stand-alone graduate or professional programs such as medicine, law, veterinary, dentistry, social work, business, or public health in which faculty teach virtually only graduate level students. Do not count undergraduate or graduate student teaching assistants as faculty.\n25.4 to 1 (based on _34103_ FTE students and _1339_ FTE faculty)\n\n## I-3. Undergraduate Class Size\n\nIn the table below, please use the following definitions to report information about the size of classes and class sections offered in the Fall 2004 term.\n\nClass Sections: A class section is an organized course offered for credit, identified by discipline and number, meeting at a stated time or times in a classroom or similar setting, and not a subsection such as a laboratory or discussion session. Undergraduate class sections are defined as any sections in which at least one degreeseeking undergraduate student is enrolled for credit. Exclude distance learning classes and noncredit classes and individual instruction such as dissertation or thesis research, music instruction, or one-to-one readings. Exclude students in independent study, co-operative programs, internships, foreign language taped tutor sessions, practicums, and all students in one-on-one classes. Each class section should be counted only once and should not be duplicated because of course catalog cross-listings.\n\nClass Subsections: A class subsection includes any subsection of a course, such as laboratory, recitation, and discussion subsections that are supplementary in nature and are scheduled to meet separately from the lecture portion of the course. Undergraduate subsections are defined as any subsections of courses in which degree-seeking undergraduate students are enrolled for credit. As above, exclude noncredit classes and individual instruction such as dissertation or thesis research, music instruction, or one-to-one readings. Each class subsection should be counted only once and should not be duplicated because of cross-listings.\n\nUsing the above definitions, please report for each of the following class-size intervals the number of class sections and class subsections offered in Fall 2003. For example, a lecture class with 800 students who met at another time in 40 separate labs with 20 students should be counted once in the \"100+\" column in the class section column and 40 times under the \"20-29\" column of the class subsections table.\n\n## Number of Class Sections with Undergraduates Enrolled.\n\nUndergraduate Class Size (provide numbers)\n\n|  | 2-9 | 10-19 | 20-29 | 30-39 | 40-49 | 50-99 | 100+ | Total |\n| :-- | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |\n| Class <br> Sections | 361 | 494 | 800 | 438 | 369 | 416 | 160 | 3038 |\n|  | 2-9 | 10-19 | 20-29 | 30-39 | 40-49 | 50-99 | 100+ | Total |\n| Class Sub- <br> sections | 69 | 172 | 204 | 161 | 53 | 15 | 0 | 674 |","images":[],"dimensions":{"dpi":200,"height":2200,"width":1700}},{"index":25,"markdown":"# 3. DEGREES CONFERRED \n\n## Degrees conferred between July 1, 2003 and June 30, 2004\n\nFor each of the following discipline areas, provide the percentage of diplomas/certificates, associate, and bachelor's degrees awarded. To determine the percentage, use majors, not headcount (e.g., students with one degree but a double major will be represented twice). Calculate the percentage from your institutions Completions by using ghe sum of 1st and 2nd majors for each CIP code as the numerator and the sum of the Grand Total by 1st Majors and the Grand Total by 2nd major as the denominator. If you prefer, you can compute the percentages using 1st majors only.\n\n| Category | Diploma/ Certificate | Associate | Bachelor's | CIP 2000 categories to include |\n| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |\n| Agriculture |  |  | 0 | 1 |\n| Architecture |  |  | 0 | 4 |\n| Area and Ethnic Studies |  |  | 0 | 5 |\n| Biological/Life Sciences |  |  | 2.9 | 26 |\n| Business/Marketing |  |  | 27.7 | 52 |\n| Communications/Communication Technologies |  |  | 5.5 | 9 and 10 |\n| Computer and Information Sciences |  |  | 2.7 | 11 |\n| Education |  |  | 9.3 | 13 |\n| Engineering/Engineering Technologies |  |  | 6.6 | 14 and 15 |\n| English |  |  | 3.9 | 23 |\n| Foreign Languages and Literature |  |  | 0.3 | 16 |\n| Health Professions and Related Sciences |  |  | 7.4 | 51 |\n| Home Economics \\& Vocational Home Economics |  |  | 0 | 19 |\n| Interdisciplinary Studies |  |  | 0 | 30 |\n| Law/Legal Studies |  |  | 2.6 | 22 |\n| Liberal Arts/General Studies |  |  | 6.5 | 24 |\n| Library Science |  |  | 0 | 25 |\n| Mathematics |  |  | 0.4 | 27 |\n| Military Science and Technologies |  |  | 0 | 29 |\n| Natural Resources/Environmental Science |  |  | 0 | 3 |\n| Parks and Recreation |  |  | 0 | 31 |\n| Personal and Miscellaneous Services |  |  | 0 | 12 |\n| Philosophy, Religion, Theology |  |  | 0.2 | 38 and 39 |\n| Physical Sciences |  |  | 0.2 | 40 and 41 |\n| Protective Services/Public Administration |  |  | 5.8 | 43 and 44 |\n| Psychology |  |  | 9.3 | 42 |\n| Social Sciences and History |  |  | 5.0 | 45 and 54 |\n| Trade and Industry |  |  | 0 | 46, 47, 48, and 49 |","images":[],"dimensions":{"dpi":200,"height":2200,"width":1700}},{"index":26,"markdown":"| Visual and Performing Arts |  |  | 3.7 | 50 |\n| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |\n| Other |  |  | 0 |  |\n| Total |  |  | $100 \\%$ |  |\n\nContact Person: Pat Ramsey\nThis site is maintained by Institutional Knowledge Management","images":[],"dimensions":{"dpi":200,"height":2200,"width":1700}}],"model":"mistral-ocr-2503-completion","usage_info":{"pages_processed":27,"doc_size_bytes":584058}}
