To determine the percentage, use majors, not headcount (e.g., students with one degree but a double major will be represented twice). Calculate the percentage from your institution's IPEDS Completions by using the sum of $1^{\\text {st }}$ and $2^{\\text {nd }}$ majors for each CIP code as the numerator and the sum of the Grand Total by 1st Majors and the Grand Total by $2^{\\text {nd }}$ major as the denominator. If you prefer, you can compute the percentages using $1^{\\text {st }}$ majors only.\n\n| Category | Diploma/ Certificates | Associate | Bachelor's | CIP 2020 <br> Categories to Include |\n| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |\n| Agriculture |  |  | 0.0 | 1 |\n| Natural resources and conservation |  |  | 0.7 | 3 |\n| Architecture |  |  | 0.3 | 4 |\n| Area, ethnic, and gender studies |  |  | 0.1 | 5 |\n| Communication/journalism |  |  | 3.4 | 9 |\n| Communication technologies |  |  | 0.0 | 10 |\n| Computer and information sciences |  |  | 5.5 | 11 |\n| Personal and culinary services |  |  | 0.0 | 12 |\n| Education |  |  | 3.6 | 13 |\n| Engineering |  |  | 8.7 | 14 |\n| Engineering technologies |  |  | 0.0 | 15 |\n| Foreign languages, literatures, and linguistics |  |  | 0.1 | 16 |\n| Family and consumer sciences |  |  | 0.0 | 19 |\n| Law/legal studies |  |  | 1.7 | 22 |\n| English |  |  | 2.4 | 23 |\n| Liberal arts/general studies |  |  | 0.1 | 24 |\n| Library science |  |  | 0.0 | 25 |\n| Biological/life sciences |  |  | 5.8 | 26 |\n| Mathematics and statistics |  |  | 0.7 | 27 |\n| Military science and military technologies |  |  | 0.0 | 28 and 29 |\n| Interdisciplinary studies |  |  | 5.5 | 30 |\n| Parks and recreation |  |  | 2.2 | 31 |\n| Philosophy and religious studies |  |  | 0.3 | 38 |\n| Theology and religious vocations |  |  | 0.0 | 39 |\n| Physical sciences |  |  | 0.6 | 40 |\n| Science technologies |  |  | 0.0 | 41 |\n| Psychology |  |  | 10.2 | 42 |\n| Homeland Security, law enforcement, firefighting, and protective services |  |  | 3.6 | 43 |\n| Public administration and social services |  |  | 1.2 | 44 |\n| Social sciences |  |  | 4.3 | 45 |\n| Construction trades |  |  | 0.0 | 46 |\n| Mechanic and repair technologies |  |  | 0.0 | 47 |\n| Precision production |  |  | 0.0 | 48 |\n| Transportation and materials moving |  |  | 0.0 | 49 |\n| Visual and performing arts |  |  | 7.0 | 50 |\n| Health professions and related programs |  |  | 14.6 | 51 |\n| Business/marketing |  |  | 16.4 | 52 |\n| History |  |  | 1.0 | 54 |\n| Other |  |  | 0.0 |  |\n\nEND OF SECTION J","images":[],"dimensions":{"dpi":200,"height":2200,"width":1700}},{"index":37,"markdown":"# COMMON DATA SET DEFINITIONS \n\n## All definitions related to the financial aid section appear at the end of the Definitions document.\n\nItems preceded by an asterisk (*) represent definitions agreed to among publishers which do not appear on the CDS document but may be present on individual publishers' surveys.\n\nAdditional guidance for some terms, particularly those common with the IPEDS survey, may be found here:\nhttps://surveys.nces.ed.gov/ipeds/public/glossary\n*Academic advisement: Plan under which each student is assigned to a faculty member or a trained adviser, who, through regular meetings, helps the student plan and implement immediate and long-term academic and vocational goals.\n\nAccelerated program: Completion of a college program of study in fewer than the usual number of years, most often by attending summer sessions and carrying extra courses during the regular academic term.\n\nAdmitted student: Applicant who is offered admission to a degree-granting program at your institution.\n*Adult student services: Admission assistance, support, orientation, and other services expressly for adults who have started college for the first time, or who are re-entering after a lapse of a few years.\n\nAmerican Indian or Alaska Native: A person having origins in any of the original peoples of North and South America (including Central America) and maintaining tribal affiliation or community attachment.\n\nApplication fee: That amount of money that an institution charges for processing a student's application for acceptance.
