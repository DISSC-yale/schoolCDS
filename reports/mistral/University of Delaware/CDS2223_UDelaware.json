The combined goal of this collaboration is to improve the quality and accuracy of information provided to all involved in a student's transition into higher education, as well as to reduce the reporting burden on data providers.\n\nThe CDS is a set of standards and definitions of data items rather than a survey instrument or set of data represented in a database. Each of the higher education surveys conducted by the participating publishers incorporates items from the CDS as well as unique items proprietary to each publisher. Consequently, the publishers' surveys differ in that they utilize varying numbers of items from the CDS.\n\nThose who report data for their colleges are urged to abide by the definitions and the cohorts specified when answering CDS items. They are also urged to use the answers to CDS items when responding to the numerous survey requests they receive, by distributing photocopies of their answers, posting them on their websites, or by other effective means.\n\nFurther information about the CDS initiative can be found at https://commondataset.org/.","images":[],"dimensions":{"dpi":200,"height":2200,"width":1700}},{"index":1,"markdown":"# A0.

This includes both institutional and non-institutional student aid (grants, jobs, and loans).\n\nNeed-based scholarship or grant aid: Scholarships and grants from institutional, state, federal, or other sources for which a student must have financial need to qualify.\n\nNeed-based self-help aid: Loans and jobs from institutional, state, federal, or other sources for which a student must demonstrate financial need to qualify.\n\nNon-need-based scholarship or grant aid: Scholarships and grants, gifts, or merit-based aid from institutional, state, federal, or other sources (including unrestricted funds or gifts and endowment income) awarded solely on the basis of academic achievement, merit, or any other non-need-based reason. When reporting questions H1 and H2, non-need-based aid that is used to meet need should be counted as need-based aid.\n\nNote: Suggested order of precedence for counting non-need money as need-based:\n\n1. Non-need institutional grants\n2. Non-need tuition waivers\n3. Non-need athletic awards\n4. Non-need federal grants\n5. Non-need state grants\n6. Non-need outside grants\n7. Non-need student loans\n8. Non-need parent loans\n9. Non-need work\n\nNon-need-based self-help aid: Loans and jobs from institutional, state, or other sources for which a student need not demonstrate financial need to qualify.\n\nPrivate student loans: A nonfederal loan made by a lender such as a bank, credit union or private lender used to pay for up to the annual cost of education, less any financial aid received.\n\nExternal scholarships and grants: Scholarships and grants received from outside (private) sources that students bring with them (e.g., Kiwanis, National Merit scholarships). The institution may process paperwork to receive the dollars, but it has no role in determining the recipient or the dollar amount awarded.\n\nWork study and employment: Federal and state work study aid, and any employment packaged by your institution in financial aid awards.","images":[],"dimensions":{"dpi":200,"height":2200,"width":1700}},{"index":31,"markdown":"# Aid Awarded to Enrolled Undergraduates \n\nH1.

Undergraduate class sections are defined as any sections in which at least one degree-seeking undergraduate student is enrolled for credit. Exclude distance learning classes and noncredit classes and individual instruction such as dissertation or thesis research, music instruction, or one-to-one readings. Exclude students in independent study, co-operative programs, internships, foreign language taped tutor sessions, practicums, and all students in one-on-one classes. Each class section should be counted only once and should not be duplicated because of course catalog cross-listings.\n\nClass Subsections: A class subsection includes any subsection of a course, such as laboratory, recitation, and discussion subsections that are supplementary in nature and are scheduled to meet separately from the lecture portion of the course. Undergraduate subsections are defined as any subsections of courses in which degreeseeking undergraduate students enrolled for credit. As above, exclude noncredit classes and individual instruction such as dissertation or thesis research, music instruction, or one-to-one readings.

If you prefer, you can compute the percentages using $1^{\\text {st }}$ majors only.\n\n| Category | Diploma/ Certificates | Associate | Bachelor's | CIP 2020 Categories to Include |\n| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |\n| Agriculture |  |  | 3.18 | 01 |\n| Natural resources and conservation |  |  | 1.91 | 03 |\n| Architecture |  |  | 0.34 | 04 |\n| Area, ethnic, and gender studies |  |  | 0.83 | 05 |\n| Communication/journalism |  |  | 3.81 | 09 |\n| Communication technologies |  |  |  | 10 |\n| Computer and information sciences |  |  | 3.04 | 11 |\n| Personal and culinary services |  |  |  | 12 |\n| Education |  | 8.91 | 5.33 | 13 |\n| Engineering |  |  | 9.12 | 14 |\n| Engineering technologies |  |  |  | 15 |\n| Foreign languages, literatures, and linguistics |  |  | 1.28 | 16 |\n| Family and consumer sciences |  |  | 1.91 | 19 |\n| Law/legal studies |  |  |  | 22 |\n| English |  |  | 1.52 | 23 |\n| Liberal arts/general studies |  | 91.09 | 0.34 | 24 |\n| Library science |  |  |  | 25 |\n| Biological/life sciences |  |  | 7.15 | 26 |\n| Mathematics and statistics |  |  | 1.13 | 27 |\n| Military science and military technologies |  |  |  | 28 and 29 |\n| Interdisciplinary studies |  |  | 2.17 | 30 |\n| Parks and recreation |  |  | 4.26 | 31 |\n| Philosophy and religious studies |  |  | 0.32 | 38 |\n| Theology and religious vocations |  |  |  | 39 |\n| Physical sciences |  |  | 0.91 | 40 |\n| Science technologies |  |  |  | 41 |\n| Psychology |  |  | 4.74 | 42 |","images":[],"dimensions":{"dpi":200,"height":2200,"width":1700}},{"index":41,"markdown":"| Category | Diploma/ Certificates | Associate | Bachelor's | CIP 2020 <br> Categories to Include |\n| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |\n| Homeland Security, law enforcement, firefighting, and protective services |  |  |  | 43 |\n| Public administration and social services |  |  | 1.97 | 44 |\n| Social sciences |  |  | 9.81 | 45 |\n| Construction trades |  |  |  | 46 |\n| Mechanic and repair technologies |  |  |  | 47 |\n| Precision production |  |  |  | 48 |\n| Transportation and materials moving |  |  |  | 49 |\n| Visual and performing arts |  |  | 2.13 | 50 |\n| Health professions and related programs |  |  | 10.64 | 51 |\n| Business/marketing |  |  | 20.84 | 52 |\n| History |  |  | 1.32 | 54 |\n| Other |  |  |  |  |\n| TOTAL (should be $=100 \\%$ ) | 0.00 | 100.00 | 100.00 |  |","images":[],"dimensions":{"dpi":200,"height":2200,"width":1700}},{"index":42,"markdown":"# Common Data Set Definitions \n\n## - All definitions related to the financial aid section appear at the end of the Definitions document.\n\n- Items preceded by an asterisk (*) represent definitions agreed to among publishers which do not appear on the CDS document but may be present on individual publishers' surveys.\n- Additional guidance for some terms, particularly those common with the IPEDS survey, may be found here: https://surveys.nces.ed.gov/ipeds/public/glossary\n*Academic advisement: Plan under which each student is assigned to a faculty member or a trained adviser, who, through regular meetings, helps the student plan and implement immediate and long-term academic and vocational goals.\n\nAccelerated program: Completion of a college program of study in fewer than the usual number of years, most often by attending summer sessions and carrying extra courses during the regular academic term.\n\nAdmitted student: Applicant who is offered admission to a degree-granting program at your institution.\n*Adult student services: Admission assistance, support, orientation, and other services expressly for adults who have started college for the first time, or who are re-entering after a lapse of a few years.\n\nAmerican Indian or Alaska Native: A person having origins in any of the original peoples of North and South America (including Central America) and maintaining tribal affiliation or community attachment.\n\nApplicant (first-time, first year): An individual who has fulfilled the institution's requirements to be considered for admission (including payment or waiving of the application fee, if any) and who has been notified of one of the following actions: admission, nonadmission, placement on waiting list, or application withdrawn (by applicant or institution).\n\nApplication fee: That amount of money that an institution charges for processing a student's application for acceptance.
