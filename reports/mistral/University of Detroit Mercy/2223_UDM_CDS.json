FINANCIAL AID \n\n## Please refer to the following financial aid definitions when completing Section H.\n\nAwarded aid: The dollar amounts offered to financial aid applicants.\nFinancial aid applicant: Any applicant who submits any one of the institutionally required financial aid applications/forms, such as the FAFSA. Indebtedness: Aggregate dollar amount borrowed through any loan program (federal, state, subsidized, unsubsidized, private, etc.; excluding parent loans) while the student was enrolled at an institution. Student loans co-signed by a parent are assumed to be the responsibility of the student and should be included.\nInstitutional scholarships and grants: Endowed scholarships, annual gifts and tuition funded grants for which the institution determines the recipient. Financial need: As determined by your institution using the federal methodology and/or your institution's own standards.\nNeed-based aid: College-funded or college-administered award from institutional, state, federal, or other sources for which a student must have financial need to qualify. This includes both institutional and non-institutional student aid (grants, jobs, and loans).\nNeed-based scholarship or grant aid: Scholarships and grants from institutional, state, federal, or other sources for which a student must have financial need to qualify.\nNeed-based self-help aid: Loans and jobs from institutional, state, federal, or other sources for which a student must demonstrate financial need to Non-need-based scholarship or grant aid: Scholarships and grants, gifts, or merit-based aid from institutional, state, federal, or other sources (including unrestricted funds or gifts and endowment income) awarded solely on the basis of academic achievement, merit, or any other non-needbased reason. When reporting questions H 1 and H 2 , non-need-based aid that is used to meet need should be counted as need-based aid.\n\nNote: Suggested order of precedence for counting non-need money as need-based:\n\n1. Non-need institutional grants\n2. Non-need tuition waivers\n3. Non-need athletic awards\n4. Non-need federal grants\n5. Non-need market loans\n\nNon-need-based self-help aid: Loans and jobs from institutional, state, or other sources for which a student need not demonstrate financial need to qualify.\nPrivate student loans: A nonfederal loan made by a lender such as a bank, credit union or private lender used to pay for up to the annual cost of education, less any financial aid received.\nexternal scholarships and grants: scholarships and grants received from outside (private) sources that students bring with them (e.g., Kiwans, National Merit scholarships). The institution may process paperwork to receive the dollars, but it has no role in determining the recipient or the dollar amount awarded.\nWork study and employment: Federal and state work study aid, and any employment packaged by your institution in financial aid awards.\nDO NOT INCLUDE ANY AID RELATED TO THE CARES ACT OR UNIQUE TO THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC\n\n## Aid Awarded to Enrolled Undergraduates\n\nEnter total dollar amounts awarded to enrolled full-time and less than full-time degree-seeking undergraduates (using the same cohort reported in CDS Question B1, \"total degree-seeking\" undergraduates) in the following categories.\n\n- If the data being reported are final figures for the 2021-2022 academic year (see the next item below), use the 2021-2022 academic year's CDS Question B1 cohort.\n- Include aid awarded to international students (i.e., those not qualifying for federal aid).\n- Aid that is non-need-based but that was used to meet need should be reported in the need-based aid column.\n- For a suggested order of precedence in assigning categories of aid to cover need, see the entry for \"non-need-based scholarship or grant aid\" on the last page of the definitions section.\n- Do NOT include any aid related to the CARES Act or unique to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n| Indicate the academic year for which data are reported for items H1, H2, H2A, and H6 below: |  | 2022-2023 <br> estimated | 2021-2022 Final |\n| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |\n| H3 | Which needs-analysis methodology does your institution use in awarding institutional aid? |  |  |\n|  | Federal methodology (FM) | X |  |\n|  | Institutional methodology (IM) |  |  |\n|  | Both FM and IM |  |  |\n| H1 | Aid | Need-based \\$ (Include non-need-based aid used to meet need.) | Non-need-based \\$ (Exclude non-need-based aid used to meet need.) |\n|  | Scholarships/Grants |  |  |\n|  | Federal | \\$5,810,327 | \\$0 |\n|  | State (i.e., all states, not only the state in which your institution is located) | \\$3,295,617 | \\$0 |\n|  | Institutional: Endowed scholarships, annual gifts and tuition funded grants, awarded by the college <br> Note: Excludes athletic aid and tuition waivers (which are reported below). | \\$18,926,865 | \\$11,366,909 |\n|  | Scholarships/grants from external sources (e.g., Kiwans, National Merit) not awarded by the college | \\$865,375 | \\$260,380 |\n|  | Total Scholarships/Grants | \\$28,698,184 | \\$11,627,289 |\n|  | Self-Help |  |  |\n|  | Student loans from all sources (excluding parent loans) | \\$7,203,874 | \\$1,941,926 |\n|  | Federal Work-Study | \\$915,428 |  |\n|  | State and other (e.g., institutional) work-study/employment <br> Note: Excludes Federal Work-Study captured above. | \\$0 | \\$0 |\n|  | Total Self-Help | \\$8,119,302 | \\$1,941,926 |\n|  | Other |  |  |\n|  | Parent Loans | \\$2,546,456 | \\$1,599,122 |\n|  | Tuition Waivers |  |  |\n|  | Reporting is optional.

To determine the percentage, use majors, not headcount (e.g., students with one degree but a double major will be represented twice). Calculate the percentage from your institution's IPEDS Completions by using the sum of 1st and 2nd majors for each CIP code as the numerator and the sum of the Grand Total by 1st Majors and the Grand Total by 2nd major as the denominator. If you prefer, you can compute the percentages using 1st majors only.\n\n| Category | Diploma/Certificates | Associate | Bachelor's | CIP 2020 Categories to Include |\n| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |\n| Agriculture | 0.00\\% | N/A | 0.00\\% | 01 |\n| Natural resources and conservation | 0.00\\% |  | 0.00\\% | 03 |\n| Architecture | 0.00\\% |  | 6.16\\% | 04 |\n| Area, ethnic, and gender studies | 0.00\\% |  | 0.00\\% | 05 |\n| Communication/pournalism | 0.00\\% |  | 1.58\\% | 09 |\n| Communication technologies | 0.00\\% |  | 0.00\\% | 10 |\n| Computer and information sciences | 0.00\\% |  | 1.90\\% | 11 |\n| Personal and culinary services | 0.00\\% |  | 0.00\\% | 12 |\n| Education | 0.00\\% |  | 0.79\\% | 13 |\n| Engineering | 0.00\\% |  | 7.27\\% | 14 |\n| Engineering technologies | 0.00\\% |  | 0.00\\% | 15 |\n| Foreign languages, literatures, and linguistics | 81.39\\% |  | 0.00\\% | 16 |\n| Family and consumer sciences | 0.00\\% |  | 0.00\\% | 19 |\n| Law/legal studies | 11.63\\% |  | 0.00\\% | 22 |\n| English | 0.00\\% |  | 0.47\\% | 23 |\n| Liberal arts/general studies | 0.00\\% |  | 0.32\\% | 24 |\n| Library science | 0.00\\% |  | 0.00\\% | 25 |\n| Biological/life sciences | 0.00\\% |  | 19.59\\% | 26 |\n| Mathematics and statistics | 0.00\\% |  | 0.32\\% | 27 |\n| Military science and military technologies | 0.00\\% |  | 0.00\\% | 28 \\& 29 |\n| Interdisciplinary studies | 0.00\\% |  | 0.00\\% | 30 |\n| Parks and recreation | 0.00\\% |  | 0.00\\% | 31 |\n| Philosophy and religious studies | 0.00\\% |  | 0.00\\% | 38 |\n| Theology and religious vocations | 0.00\\% |  | 0.00\\% | 39 |\n| Physical sciences | 0.00\\% |  | 1.26\\% | 40 |\n| Science technologies | 0.00\\% |  | 0.00\\% | 41 |\n| Psychology | 0.00\\% |  | 3.48\\% | 42 |\n| Homeland Security, law enforcement, firefighting, and protective services | 0.00\\% |  | 1.42\\% | 43 |\n| Public administration and social services | 0.00\\% |  | 2.21\\% | 44 |\n| Social sciences | 0.00\\% |  | 1.74\\% | 45 |\n| Construction trades | 0.00\\% |  | 0.00\\% | 46 |\n| Mechanic and repair technologies | 0.00\\% |  | 0.00\\% | 47 |\n| Precision production | 0.00\\% |  | 0.00\\% | 48 |\n| Transportation and materials moving | 0.00\\% |  | 0.00\\% | 49 |\n| Visual and performing arts | 0.00\\% |  | 0.32\\% | 50 |\n| Health professions and related programs | 0.00\\% |  | 41.06\\% | 51 |\n| Business/marketing | 6.98\\% |  | 9.64\\% | 52 |\n| History | 0.00\\% |  | 0.47\\% | 54 |\n| Other | 0.00\\% |  | 0.00\\% |  |\n| TOTAL (should $=100 \\%$ ) | 100.00\\% |  | 100.00\\% |  |","images":[],"dimensions":{"dpi":200,"height":2201,"width":1700}}],"model":"mistral-ocr-2503-completion","usage_info":{"pages_processed":21,"doc_size_bytes":546425}}
