{"pages":[{"index":0,"markdown":"# Common Data Set 2021-2022 \n\n## Welcome to the 2021-2022 Common Data Set collection!\n\nThe Common Data Set (CDS) initiative is a collaborative effort among data providers in the higher education community and publishers as represented by the College Board, Peterson's, and U.S. News \\& World Report. The combined goal of this collaboration is to improve the quality and accuracy of information provided to all involved in a student's transition into higher education, as well as to reduce the reporting burden on data providers.\n\nThe CDS is a set of standards and definitions of data items rather than a survey instrument or set of data represented in a database. Each of the higher education surveys conducted by the participating publishers incorporates items from the CDS as well as unique items proprietary to each publisher. Consequently, the publishers' surveys differ in that they utilize varying numbers of items from the CDS.\n\nThose who report data for their colleges are urged to abide by the definitions and the cohorts specified when answering CDS items. They are also urged to use the answers to CDS items when responding to the numerous survey requests they receive, by distributing photocopies of their answers, posting them on their websites, or by other effective means.\n\nFurther information about the CDS initiative can be found at https://commondataset.org/.","images":[],"dimensions":{"dpi":200,"height":2200,"width":1700}},{"index":1,"markdown":"# A0.

To determine the percentage, use majors, not headcount (e.g., students with one degree but a double major will be represented twice). Calculate the percentage from your institution's IPEDS Completions by using the sum of $1^{\\text {st }}$ and $2^{\\text {nd }}$ majors for each CIP code as the numerator and the sum of the Grand Total by 1st Majors and the Grand Total by $2^{\\text {nd }}$ major as the denominator. If you prefer, you can compute the percentages using $1^{\\text {st }}$ majors only.\n\n| Category | Diploma/ Certificates | Associate | Bachelor's | CIP 2020 Categories to Include |\n| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |\n| Agriculture |  |  |  | 01 |\n| Natural resources and conservation |  |  |  | 03 |\n| Architecture |  |  |  | 04 |\n| Area, ethnic, and gender studies |  |  |  | 05 |\n| Communication/journalism |  |  |  | 09 |\n| Communication technologies |  |  |  | 10 |\n| Computer and information sciences |  |  | 3.00 | 11 |\n| Personal and culinary services |  |  |  | 12 |\n| Education |  |  | 10.00 | 13 |\n| Engineering |  |  |  | 14 |\n| Engineering technologies |  |  | 1.00 | 15 |\n| Foreign languages, literatures, and linguistics |  |  | 1.00 | 16 |\n| Family and consumer sciences |  |  | 1.00 | 19 |\n| Law/legal studies |  |  |  | 22 |\n| English |  |  | 2.00 | 23 |\n| Liberal arts/general studies |  |  |  | 24 |\n| Library science |  |  |  | 25 |\n| Biological/life sciences |  |  | 4.00 | 26 |\n| Mathematics and statistics |  |  | 1.00 | 27 |\n| Military science and military technologies |  |  |  | 28 and 29 |\n| Interdisciplinary studies |  |  | 5.00 | 30 |\n| Parks and recreation |  |  | 7.00 | 31 |\n| Philosophy and religious studies |  |  |  | 38 |\n| Theology and religious vocations |  |  |  | 39 |\n| Physical sciences |  |  | 3.00 | 40 |\n| Science technologies |  |  |  | 41 |\n| Psychology |  |  | 4.00 | 42 |","images":[],"dimensions":{"dpi":200,"height":2200,"width":1700}},{"index":39,"markdown":"| Category | Diploma/ Certificates | Associate | Bachelor's | CIP 2020 <br> Categories to Include |\n| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |\n| Homeland Security, law enforcement, firefighting, and protective services |  |  | 2.00 | 43 |\n| Public administration and social services |  |  | 5.00 | 44 |\n| Social sciences |  |  | 4.00 | 45 |\n| Construction trades |  |  |  | 46 |\n| Mechanic and repair technologies |  |  |  | 47 |\n| Precision production |  |  |  | 48 |\n| Transportation and materials moving |  |  |  | 49 |\n| Visual and performing arts |  |  | 5.00 | 50 |\n| Health professions and related programs |  |  | 13.00 | 51 |\n| Business/marketing |  |  | 24.00 | 52 |\n| History |  |  | 1.00 | 54 |\n| Other |  |  | 4.00 |  |\n| TOTAL (should be $=100 \\%$ ) | 0.00 | 0.00 | 100.00 |  |","images":[],"dimensions":{"dpi":200,"height":2200,"width":1700}},{"index":40,"markdown":"# Common Data Set Definitions \n\n## - All definitions related to the financial aid section appear at the end of the Definitions document.\n\n- Items preceded by an asterisk (*) represent definitions agreed to among publishers which do not appear on the CDS document but may be present on individual publishers' surveys.\n*Academic advisement: Plan under which each student is assigned to a faculty member or a trained adviser, who, through regular meetings, helps the student plan and implement immediate and long-term academic and vocational goals.\n\nAccelerated program: Completion of a college program of study in fewer than the usual number of years, most often by attending summer sessions and carrying extra courses during the regular academic term.\n\nAdmitted student: Applicant who is offered admission to a degree-granting program at your institution.\n*Adult student services: Admission assistance, support, orientation, and other services expressly for adults who have started college for the first time, or who are re-entering after a lapse of a few years.\n\nAmerican Indian or Alaska Native: A person having origins in any of the original peoples of North and South America (including Central America) and maintaining tribal affiliation or community attachment.\n\nApplicant (first-time, first year): An individual who has fulfilled the institution's requirements to be considered for admission (including payment or waiving of the application fee, if any) and who has been notified of one of the following actions: admission, nonadmission, placement on waiting list, or application withdrawn (by applicant or institution).\n\nApplication fee: That amount of money that an institution charges for processing a student's application for acceptance.
