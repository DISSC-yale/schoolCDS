Student loans co-signed by a parent are assumed to be the responsibility of the student and should be included.\n\nInstitutional scholarships and grants: Endowed scholarships, annual gifts and tuition funded grants for which the institution determines the recipient.\n\nFinancial need: As determined by your institution using the federal methodology and/or your institution's own standards.\n\nNeed-based aid: College-funded or college-administered award from institutional, state, federal, or other sources for which a student must have financial need to qualify. This includes both institutional and noninstitutional student aid (grants, jobs, and loans).\n\nNeed-based scholarship or grant aid: Scholarships and grants from institutional, state, federal, or other sources for which a student must have financial need to qualify.\n\nNeed-based self-help aid: Loans and jobs from institutional, state, federal, or other sources for which a student must demonstrate financial need to qualify.\n\nNon-need-based scholarship or grant aid: Scholarships and grants, gifts, or merit-based aid from institutional, state, federal, or other sources (including unrestricted funds or gifts and endowment income) awarded solely on the basis of academic achievement, merit, or any other non-need-based reason. When reporting questions H 1 and H 2 , non-need-based aid that is used to meet need should be counted as needbased aid.\nNote: Suggested order of precedence for counting non-need money as need-based:\n\n1. Non-need institutional grants\n2. Non-need outsideshits\n3. Non-need tuition waivers\n4. Non-need student loans\n5. Non-need athletic awards\n6. Non-need parent loans\n7. Non-need federal grants\n8. Non-need work\n9. Non-need state grants\n\nNon-need-based self-help aid: Loans and jobs from institutional, state, or other sources for which a student need not demonstrate financial need to qualify.\n\nPrivate student loans: A nonfederal loan made by a lender such as a bank, credit union or private lender used to pay for up to the annual cost of education, less any financial aid received.\n\nExternal scholarships and grants: Scholarships and grants received from outside (private) sources that students bring with them (e.g., Kiwanis, National Merit scholarships). The institution may process paperwork to receive the dollars, but it has no role in determining the recipient or the dollar amount Work study and employment: Federal and state work study aid, and any employment packaged by your institution in financial aid awards.\n\n## DO NOT INCLUDE ANY AID RELATED TO THE CARES ACT OR UNIQUE THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC\n\n## Aid Awarded to Enrolled Underaraduates\n\nH1 Enter total dollar amounts awarded to enrolled full-time and less than full-time degree-seeking undergraduates (using the same cohort reported in CDS Question B1, \"total degree-seeking\" undergraduates) in the following categories.\n\n- If the data being reported are final figures for the 2022-2023 academic year (see the next item below), use the 2022-2023 academic year's CDS Question B1 cohort.\n- Include aid awarded to international students (i.e., those not qualifying for federal aid).\n- Aid that is non-need-based but that was used to meet need should be reported in the need-based aid column.\n- For a suggested order of precedence in assigning categories of aid to cover need, see the entry for \"non-\n- Do NOT include any aid related to the CARES Act or unique to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nIndicate the academic year for which data are reported for items $\\mathbf{H 1}$, H2, H2A, and H6 below:\n\n| 2023-2024 | 2022-2023 Final |\n| :--: | :--: |\n| $x$ |  |","images":[],"dimensions":{"dpi":200,"height":2858,"width":2208}},{"index":20,"markdown":"Which needs-analysis methodology does your institution use in awarding institutional aid?

Undergraduate class sections are defined as any sections in which at least one degree-seeking undergraduate student is enrolled for credit. Exclude distance learning classes and noncredit classes and individual instruction such as dissertation or thesis research, music instruction, or one-to-one readings. Exclude students in independent study, co-operative programs, internships, foreign language taped tutor sessions, practicums, and all students in one-on-one classes. Each class section should be counted only once and should not be duplicated because of course catalog cross-listings.\n\nClass Subsections: A class subsection includes any subsection of a course, such as laboratory, recitation, and discussion subsections that are supplementary in nature and are scheduled to meet separately from the lecture portion of the course. Undergraduate subsections are defined as any subsections of courses in which degree-seeking undergraduate students enrolled for credit. As above, exclude noncredit classes and individual instruction such as dissertation or thesis research, music instruction, or one-to-one readings. Each class subsection should be counted only once and should not be duplicated because of cross-listings.\n\nUsing the above definitions, please report for each of the following class-size intervals the number of class sections and class subsections offered in Fall 2023. For example, a lecture class with 800 students who met at another time in 40 separate labs with 20 students should be counted once in the \"100+\" column in the class section column and 40 times under the \"20-29\" column of the class subsections table.\n\n## Number of Class Sections with Undergraduates Enrolled\n\nUndergraduate Class Size (provide numbers)\n\n|  | $\\mathbf{2 - 9}$ | $\\mathbf{1 0 - 1 9}$ | $\\mathbf{2 0 - 2 9}$ | $\\mathbf{3 0 - 3 9}$ | $\\mathbf{4 0 - 4 9}$ | $\\mathbf{5 0 - 9 9}$ | $\\mathbf{1 0 0 +}$ | Total |\n| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |\n| CLASS <br> SECTIONS | 317 | 532 | 683 | 330 | 194 | 164 | 88 | 2308 |\n\n\n|  | $\\mathbf{2 - 9}$ | $\\mathbf{1 0 - 1 9}$ | $\\mathbf{2 0 - 2 9}$ | $\\mathbf{3 0 - 3 9}$ | $\\mathbf{4 0 - 4 9}$ | $\\mathbf{5 0 - 9 9}$ | $\\mathbf{1 0 0 +}$ | Total |\n| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |\n| CLASS SUB- <br> SECTIONS | 90 | 336 | 199 | 31 | 5 | 3 | 3 | 667 |","images":[],"dimensions":{"dpi":200,"height":2341,"width":1809}},{"index":26,"markdown":"# J.
