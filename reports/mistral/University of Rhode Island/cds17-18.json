Undergraduate class sections are defined as any sections in which at least one degree-seeking undergraduate student is enrolled for credit.

Undergraduate subsections are defined as any subsections of courses in which degree-seeking undergraduate students enrolled for credit. As above, exclude noncredit classes and individual instruction such as dissertation or thesis research, music instruction, or one-to-one readings.
