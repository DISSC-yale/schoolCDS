Employees who are not considered full-time instructional faculty but who teach one or more non-clinical credit courses may be counted as part-time faculty.\nMinority faculty: includes faculty who designate themselves as Black, non-Hispanic; American Indian or Alaska Native; Asian, Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander, or Hispanic.\nDoctorate: includes such degrees as Doctor of Philosophy, Doctor of Education, Doctor of Juridical Science, and Doctor of Public Health in any field such as arts, sciences, education, engineering, business, and public administration. Also includes terminal degrees formerly designated as \"first professional\", including dentistry (DDS or DMD), medicine (MD), optometry (OD), osteopathic medicine (DO), pharmacy (DPharm or BPharm), podiatric medicine (DPM), veterinary medicine (DVM), chiropractic (DC or DCM), or law (JD).\nTerminal master's degree: a master's degree that is considered the highest degree in a field: example, M. Arch (in architecture) and MFA (master of fine arts in art or theater), or theological professions (MDiv, MHL).\n![img-17.jpeg](img-17.jpeg)","images":[{"id":"img-17.jpeg","top_left_x":311,"top_left_y":1705,"bottom_right_x":1128,"bottom_right_y":1955,"image_base64":null}],"dimensions":{"dpi":200,"height":2200,"width":1700}},{"index":41,"markdown":"# CDS I2. Student to Faculty Ratio \n\nReport the fall 2010 ratio of full-time equivalent students (full-time plus $1 / 3$ part time) to full-time equivalent instructional faculty (full time plus $1 / 3$ part time). In the ratio calculations, exclude both faculty and students in stand-alone graduate or professional programs such as medicine, law, veterinary, dentistry, social work, business, or public health in which faculty teach virtually only graduate level students. Do not count undergraduate or graduate student teaching assistants as faculty. If faculty teach graduate students and are not part of a stand-alone graduate school they should be included in the student to faculty ratio calculations and counts, if graduate students are not part of a stand-alone graduate school they should be included in the student to faculty ratio calculations and counts.\n\nFall 2010 Student to Faculty ratio: $\\square$ to 1 (based on $\\square$ students and $\\square$ faculty).\n\n## CDS I3. Undergraduate Class Size\n\nIn the table below, please use the following definitions to report information about the size of classes and class sections offered in the Fall 2010 term.\n\nClass Sections: A class section is an organized course offered for credit, identified by discipline and number, meeting at a stated time or times in a classroom or similar setting, and not a subsection such as a laboratory or discussion session. Undergraduate class sections are defined as any sections in which at least one degree-seeking undergraduate student is enrolled for credit. Exclude distance learning classes and noncredit classes and individual instruction such as dissertation or thesis research, music instruction, or one-to-one readings. Exclude students in independent study, co-operative programs, internships, foreign language taped tutor sessions, practicums, and all students in one-on-one classes. Each class section should be counted only once and should not be duplicated because of course catalog crosslistings.\n\nClass Subsections: A class subsection includes any subsection of a course, such as laboratory, recitation, and discussion subsections that are supplementary in nature and are scheduled to meet separately from the lecture portion of the course. Undergraduate subsections are defined as any subsections of courses in which degree-seeking undergraduate students enrolled for credit. As above, exclude noncredit classes and individual instruction such as dissertation or thesis research, music instruction, or one-to-one readings. Each class subsection should be counted only once and should not be duplicated because of cross-listings.\n\nUsing the above definitions, please report for each of the following class-size intervals the number of class sections and class subsections offered in Fall 2010. For example, a lecture class with 800 students who met at another time in 40 separate labs with 20 students should be counted once in the \"100+\" column in the class section column and 40 times under the \"20-29\" column of the class subsections table.\n\n## Number of Class Sections with Undergraduates Enrolled.\n\nUndergraduate Class Size (provide numbers)\n\n| Class | 2-9 | 10-19 | 20-29 | 30-39 | 40-49 | 50-99 | 100+ | Total |\n| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |\n|  | 261 | 508 | 651 | 251 | 239 | 238 | 182 | 2330 |\n|  | 231 | 452 | 1038 | 250 | 108 | 50 | 1 | 2130 |\n\n## J. Degrees Offered and Awarded\n\n## CDS J. Disciplinary areas of DEGREES CONFERRED\n\n## Degrees conferred between July 1, 2009 and June 30, 2010\n\nFor each of the following discipline areas, provide the percentage of diplomas/certificates, associate, and bachelor's degrees awarded. To determine the percentage, use majors, not headcount (e.g., students with one degree but a double major will be represented twice). Calculate the percentage from your institution's IPEDS Completions by using the sum of 1st and 2nd majors for each CIP code as the numerator and the sum of the Grand Total by 1st majors and the Grand Total by 2nd major as the denominator. If you prefer, you can compute the percentages using 1st majors only.\n\nPlease note that the only certificate reported in the Degrees Conferred chart below is the certificate below the Associate degree. Any/all other certificates (i.e., Postbachelor's certificate, Post-master's certificate) should not be reported in this chart.\n\nC=Certificate BELOW the Associate degree; A=Associate; B=Bachelor's\n\n|  | Diploma/Certificate | Associate <br> degrees | Bachelor's <br> degrees | CIP 2010 <br> Categories to <br> Include |\n| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |\n| Agriculture |  |  |  | 1 |","images":[],"dimensions":{"dpi":200,"height":2200,"width":1700}},{"index":42,"markdown":"![img-18.jpeg](img-18.jpeg)\nK.
