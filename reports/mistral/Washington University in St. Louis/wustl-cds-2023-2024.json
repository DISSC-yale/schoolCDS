Student loans co-signed by a parent are assumed to be the responsibility of the student and should be included.\n\nInstitutional scholarships and grants: Endowed scholarships, annual gifts and tuition funded grants for which the institution determines the recipient.\n\nFinancial need: As determined by your institution using the federal methodology and/or your institution's own standards.\nNeed-based aid: College-funded or college-administered award from institutional, state, federal, or other sources for which a student must have financial need to qualify. This includes both institutional and non-institutional student aid (grants, jobs, and loans).\n\nNeed-based scholarship or grant aid: Scholarships and grants from institutional, state, federal, or other sources for which a student must have financial need to qualify.\n\nNeed-based self-help aid: Loans and jobs from institutional, state, federal, or other sources for which a student must demonstrate financial need to qualify.\n\nNon-need-based scholarship or grant aid: Scholarships and grants, gifts, or merit-based aid from institutional, state, federal, or other sources (including unrestricted funds or gifts and endowment income) awarded solely on the basis of academic achievement, merit, or any other non-need-based reason.

The institution may process paperwork to receive the dollars, but it has no role in determining the recipient or the dollar amount awarded.\n\nWork study and employment: Federal and state work study aid, and any employment packaged by your institution in financial aid awards.","images":[],"dimensions":{"dpi":200,"height":2200,"width":1700}},{"index":29,"markdown":"Washington University in St. Louis\nCommon Data Set 2023-2024\n\n# H1-H5: Aid Awarded to Enrolled Undergraduates \n\nH1.
