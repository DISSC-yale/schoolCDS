If your institution has recently implemented any major financial aid policy, program, or initiative to make your institution more affordable to incoming students such as replacing loans with grants, or waiving costs for families below a certain income level please provide details below:\nFor the 2008-2009 academic year, Yale reduced the average cost of sending a student to Yale College for families with financial need. This was the largest increase in spending for financial aid in the University's history. The reduction in costs was spread across a broad range of incomes. Families with incomes below $\\$ 120,000$ saw their contributions cut by more than $50 \\%$ from the previous year, while most families with incomes between $\\$ 120,000$ and $\\$ 200,000$ saw cost reductions of $33 \\%$ or more. Families earning less than $\\$ 60,000$ annually will not make any contribution toward the cost of a child's education, and families earning $\\$ 60,000$ to $\\$ 120,000$ will typically contribute from $1 \\%$ to $10 \\%$ of total family income. The contribution of aided families earning above $\\$ 120,000$ will average $10 \\%$ of income. Yale also increased the number of families who qualify for aid, eliminated the need for students to take loans, enhanced its grants to families with more than one child attending college, exempted the first $\\$ 200,000$ of family assets from the assessment of need, and increased expense allowances for foreign students during school vacation periods. Yale calculates financial aid by taking into consideration a family's total income and assets, family size and number of children in college, family medical bills, state of residence, and a number of other factors.","images":[],"dimensions":{"dpi":200,"height":2200,"width":1700}},{"index":24,"markdown":"# Yale University <br> Common Data Set 2009-10 \n\n## I.

Undergraduate class sections are defined as any sections in which at least one degree-seeking undergraduate student is enrolled for credit. Exclude distance learning classes and noncredit classes and individual instruction such as dissertation or thesis research, music instruction, or one-to-one readings. Exclude students in independent study, co-operative programs, internships, foreign language taped tutor sessions, practicums, and all students in one-on-one classes. Each class section should be counted only once and should not be duplicated because of course catalog cross-listings.\n\nClass Subsections: A class subsection includes any subsection of a course, such as laboratory, recitation, and discussion subsections that are supplementary in nature and are scheduled to meet separately from the lecture portion of the course. Undergraduate subsections are defined as any subsections of courses in which degree-seeking undergraduate students enrolled for credit. As above, exclude noncredit classes and individual instruction such as dissertation or thesis research, music instruction, or one-to-one readings. Each class subsection should be counted only once and should not be duplicated because of cross-listings.\n\nUsing the above definitions, please report for each of the following class-size intervals the number of class sections and class subsections offered in fall 2009.

The institution may process paperwork to receive the dollars, but it has no role in determining the recipient or the dollar amount awarded.\n\nFinancial aid applicant: Any applicant who submits any one of the institutionally required financial aid applications/forms, such as the FAFSA.\n\nIndebtedness: Aggregate dollar amount borrowed through any loan program (federal, state, subsidized, unsubsidized, private, etc.; excluding parent loans) while the student was enrolled at an institution. Student loans co-signed by a parent are assumed to be the responsibility of the student and should be included.\n\n\nInstitutional scholarships and grants: Endowed scholarships, annual gifts and tuition funded grants for which the institution determines the recipient.\n\nFinancial need: As determined by your institution using the federal methodology and/or your institution's own standards.\nNeed-based aid: College-funded or college-administered award from institutional, state, federal, or other sources for which a student must have financial need to qualify.
