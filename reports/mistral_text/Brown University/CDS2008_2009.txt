G1 Undergraduate full-time tuition, required fees, room and board List the typical tuition, required fees, and room and board for a full-time undergraduate student for the FULL 2009-2010 academic year (30 semester or 45 quarter hours for institutions that derive annual tuition by multiplying credit hour cost by number of credits). A full academic year refers to the period of time generally extending from September to June; usually equated to two semesters, two trimesters, three quarters, or the period covered by a four-one-four plan. Room and board is defined as double occupancy and 19 meals per week or the maximum meal plan. Required fees include only charges that all full-time students must pay that are not included in tuition (e.g., registration, health, or activity fees.) Do not include optional fees (e.g., parking, laboratory use).

# H1: 

If your institution has recently implemented any major financial aid policy, program, or initiative to make your institution more affordable to incoming students such as replacing loans with grants, or waiving costs for families below a certain income level please provide details below:

Brown University is committed to assisting families in meeting their demonstrated financial need. Several financial aid initiatives, unique to Brown, have been developed in order to better assist our families. The following is an overview of these initiatives:
- Undergraduate financial aid applicants with total parent incomes less than \$100,000, at the time of admission, do not have a loan component in their awards. Students with family earnings above $\$ 100,000$ have moderate loans ( $\$ 3,000, \$ 4,000$, or $\$ 5,000$ ) depending on family total income level.
- Families with total parent earnings less than $\$ 60,000$ and assets less than $\$ 100,000$ are not required to make a contribution toward the cost of education.
- Families with total parent earnings less than $\$ 60,000$ and assets greater than $\$ 100,000$ have a significantly reduced contribution (from assets only).
- Students are able to use outside scholarships to eliminate all of the student-effort components in their awards including the summer savings expectation.

These University initiatives are determined based on a family's calculated total income. A family's total income is determined by reviewing tax documents and financial aid application materials. Total income is the sum of Adjusted Gross Income plus all untaxed income. Examples of untaxed income include untaxed social security benefits, untaxed business revenue, pension contributions and withdrawals, child support received, etc.
# I. INSTRUCTIONAL FACULTY AND CLASS SIZE 

Please report the number of instructional faculty members in each category for Fall 2008. Include faculty who are on your institution's payroll on the census date your institution uses for IPEDS/AAUP.
The following definition of full-time instructional faculty is used by the American Association of University Professors (AAUP) in its annual Faculty Compensation Survey (the part time definitions are not used by AAUP). Instructional Faculty is defined as those members of the instructional-research staff whose major regular assignment is instruction, including those with released time for research. Use the chart below to determine inclusions and exclusions:

|  |  | Full-time | Part-time |
| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |
|  | (a) instructional faculty in preclinical and clinical medicine, faculty who are not paid (e.g., those who donate their services or are in the military), or research-only faculty, postdoctoral fellows, or pre-doctoral fellows | Exclude | Include only if they teach one or more nonclinical credit courses |
|  | (b) administrative officers with titles such as dean of students, librarian, registrar, coach, and the like, even though they may devote part of their time to classroom instruction and may have faculty status | Exclude | Include if they teach one or more non-clinical credit courses |
|  | (c) other administrators/staff who teach one or more non-clinical credit courses even though they do not have faculty status | Exclude | Include |
|  | (d) undergraduate or graduate students who assist in the instruction of courses, but have titles such as teaching assistant, teaching fellow, and the like | Exclude | Exclude |
|  | (e) faculty on sabbatical or leave with pay | Include | Exclude |
|  | (f) faculty on leave without pay | Exclude | Exclude |
|  | (g) replacement faculty for faculty on sabbatical leave or leave with pay | Exclude | Include |

Full-time instructional faculty: faculty employed on a full-time basis for instruction (including those with released time for research)
Part-time instructional faculty: Adjuncts and other instructors being paid solely for part-time classroom instruction. Also includes full-time faculty teaching less than two semesters, three quarters, two trimesters, or two four-month sessions. Employees who are not considered full-time instructional faculty but who teach one or more non-clinical credit courses may be counted as part-time faculty.
Minority faculty: includes faculty who designate themselves as black, non-Hispanic; American Indian or Alaska Native; Asian or Pacific Islander; or Hispanic.
Doctorate: includes such degrees as Doctor of Education, Doctor of Juridical Science, Doctor of Public Health, and Doctor of Philosophy degree in any field such as agronomy, food technology, education, engineering, public administration, ophthalmology, or radiology.
First-professional: includes the fields of dentistry (DDS or DMD), medicine (MD), optometry (OD), osteopathic medicine (DO), pharmacy (DPharm or BPharm), podiatric medicine (DPM), veterinary medicine (DVM), chiropractic (DC or DCM), law (JD) and theological professions (MDiv, MHL).
Terminal degree: the highest degree in a field: example, M. Arch (architecture) and MFA (master of fine arts).

## 13 Undergraduate Class Size

In the table below, please use the following definitions to report information about the size of classes and class sections offered in the Fall 2008 term.
Class Sections: A class section is an organized course offered for credit, identified by discipline and number, meeting at a stated time or times in a classroom or similar setting, and not a subsection such as a laboratory or discussion session. Undergraduate class sections are defined as any sections in which at least one degree-seeking undergraduate student is enrolled for credit. Exclude distance learning classes and noncredit classes and individual instruction such as dissertation or thesis research, music instruction, or one-to-one readings. Exclude students in independent study, co-operative programs, internships, foreign language taped tutor sessions, practicums, and all students in one-on-one classes. Each class section should be counted only once and should not be duplicated because of course catalog crosslistings.
Class Subsections: A class subsection includes any subsection of a course, such as laboratory, recitation, and discussion subsections that are supplementary in nature and are scheduled to meet separately from the lecture portion of the course. Undergraduate subsections are defined as any subsections of courses in which degree-seeking undergraduate students enrolled for credit. As above, exclude noncredit classes and individual instruction such as dissertation or thesis research, music instruction, or one-to-one readings. Each class subsection should be counted only once and should not be duplicated because of cross-listings.
Using the above definitions, please report for each of the following class-size intervals the number of class sections and class subsections offered in Fall 2008. For example, a lecture class with 800 students who met at another time in 40 separate labs with 20 students should be counted once in the " $100+$ " column in the class section column and 40 times under the "20-29" column of the class subsections table.

# J. DEGREES CONFERRED 

J1 Degrees conferred between July 1, 2007 and June 30, 2008
J1 For each of the following discipline areas, provide the percentage of diplomas/certificates, associate, and bachelor's degrees awarded. To determine the percentage, use majors, not headcount (e.g., students with one degree but a double major will be represented twice). Calculate the percentage from your institution's IPEDS Completions by using the sum of 1st and 2nd majors for each CIP code as the numerator and the sum of the Grand Total by 1st Majors and the Grand Total by 2nd major as the denominator. If you prefer, you can compute the percentages using 1st

Financial aid applicant: Any applicant who submits any one of the institutionally required financial aid applications/forms, such as the FAFSA.
Indebtedness: Aggregate dollar amount borrowed through any loan program (federal, state, subsidized, unsubsidized, private, etc.; excluding parent loans) while the student was enrolled at an institution. Student loans co-signed by a parent are assumed to be the responsibility of the student and should be included.

Institutional scholarships and grants: Endowed scholarships, annual gifts and tuition funded grants for which the institution determines the recipient.
Financial need: As determined by your institution using the federal methodology and/or your institution's own standards.
Need-based aid: College-funded or college-administered award from institutional, state, federal, or other sources for which a student must have financial need to qualify. This includes both institutional and noninstitutional student aid (grants, jobs, and loans).
Need-based scholarship or grant aid: Scholarships and grants from institutional, state, federal, or other sources for which a student must have financial need to qualify.
Need-based self-help aid: Loans and jobs from institutional, state, federal, or other sources for which a student must demonstrate financial need to qualify.
Non-need-based scholarship or grant aid: Scholarships and grants, gifts, or merit-based aid from institutional, state, federal, or other sources (including unrestricted funds or gifts and endowment income) awarded solely on the basis of academic achievement, merit, or any other non-need-based reason. When reporting questions H 1 and H 2 , non-need-based aid that is used to meet need should be counted as needbased aid.
Note: Suggested order of precedence for counting non-need money as need-based:
Non-need institutional grants
Non-need tuition waivers
Non-need athletic awards
Non-need federal grants
Non-need state grants
Non-need outside grants
Non-need student loans
Non-need parent loans
Non-need work
Non-need-based self-help aid: Loans and jobs from institutional, state, or other sources for which a student need not demonstrate financial need to qualify.
Work study and employment: Federal and state work study aid, and any employment packaged by your institution in financial aid awards.
