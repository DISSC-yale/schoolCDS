# Graduation Rates 

The items in this section correspond to data elements collected by the IPEDS Web-based Data Collection System's Graduation Rate Survey (GRS). For complete instructions and definitions of data elements, see the IPEDS GRS Forms and Instructions for the 2017-18 Survey

## For Bachelor's or Equivalent Institutions

In the following section for bachelor's or equivalent programs, please disaggregate the Fall 2010 and Fall 2011 cohorts (formerly CDS B4-B11) into four groups:

- Students who received a Federal Pell Grant*
- Recipients of a subsidized Stafford Loan who did not receive a Pell Grant
- Students who did not receive either a Pell Grant or a subsidized Stafford Loan
- Total (all students, regardless of Pell Grant or subsidized loan status)
*Students who received both a Federal Pell Grant and a subsidized Stafford Loan should be reported in the "Recipients of a Federal Pell Grant" column.
For each graduation rate grid below, the numbers in the first three columns for Questions A-G should sum to the cohort total in the fourth column (formerly CDS B4-B11).

G1 Undergraduate full-time tuition, required fees, room and board List the typical tuition, required fees, and room and board for a full-time undergraduate student for the FULL 2018-2019 academic year ( 30 semester or 45 quarter hours for institutions that derive annual tuition by multiplying credit hour cost by number of credits). A full academic year refers to the period of time generally extending from September to June; usually equated to two semesters, two trimesters, three quarters, or the period covered by a four-one-four plan. Room and board is defined as double occupancy and 19 meals per week or the maximum meal plan. Required fees include only charges that all full-time students must pay that are not included in tuition (e.g., registration, health, or activity fees.) Do not include optional fees (e.g., parking, laboratory use).

Instructional Faculty is defined as those members of the instructional-research staff whose major regular assignment is instruction, including those with released time for research. Use the chart below to determine inclusions and exclusions:

|  |  | Full-time | Part-time |
| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |
|  | (a) Instructional faculty in preclinical and clinical medicine, faculty who are not paid (e.g., those who donate their services or are in the military), or research-only faculty, postdoctoral fellows, or pre-doctoral fellows | Exclude | Include only if they teach one or more nonclinical credit courses |
|  | (b) administrative officers with titles such as dean of students, librarian, registrar, coach, and the like, even though they may devote part of their time to classroom instruction and may have faculty status | Exclude | Include if they teach one or more non-clinical credit courses |
|  | (c) other administrators/staff who teach one or more non-clinical credit courses even though they do not have faculty status | Exclude | Include |

Full-time instructional faculty: faculty employed on a full-time basis for instruction (including those with released time for research)
Part-time instructional faculty: Adjuncts and other instructors being paid solely for part-time classroom instruction. Also includes full-time faculty teaching less than two semesters, three quarters, two trimesters, or two four-month sessions. Employees who are not considered full-time instructional faculty but who teach one or more non-clinical credit courses may be counted as part-time faculty.
Minority faculty: includes faculty who designate themselves as Black, non-Hispanic; American Indian or Alaska Native; Asian, Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander, or Hispanic.
Doctorate: includes such degrees as Doctor of Philosophy, Doctor of Education, Doctor of Juridical Science, and Doctor of Public Health in any field such as arts, sciences, education, engineering, business, and public administration.

# Undergraduate Class Size 

In the table below, please use the following definitions to report information about the size of classes and class sections offered in the Fall 2017 term.
Class Sections: A class section is an organized course offered for credit, identified by discipline and number, meeting at a stated time or times in a classroom or similar setting, and not a subsection such as a laboratory or discussion session. Undergraduate class sections are defined as any sections in which at least one degree-seeking undergraduate student is enrolled for credit. Exclude distance learning classes and noncredit classes and individual instruction such as dissertation or thesis research, music instruction, or one-to-one readings. Exclude students in independent study, co-operative programs, internships, foreign language taped tutor sessions, practicums, and all students in one-on-one classes. Each class section should be counted only once and should not be duplicated because of course catalog cross-listings.

Class Subsections: A class subsection includes any subsection of a course, such as laboratory, recitation, and discussion subsections that are supplementary in nature and are scheduled to meet separately from the lecture portion of the course. Undergraduate subsections are defined as any subsections of courses in which degree-seeking undergraduate students enrolled for credit. As above, exclude noncredit classes and individual instruction such as dissertation or thesis research, music instruction, or one-to-one readings. Each class subsection should be counted only once and should not be duplicated because of cross-listings.
Using the above definitions, please report for each of the following class-size intervals the number of class sections and class subsections offered in Fall 2017. For example, a lecture class with 800 students who met at another time in 40 separate labs with 20 students should be counted once in the " $100+$ " column in the class section column and 40 times under the "20-29" column of the class subsections table.

# J. DEGREES CONFERRED 

J1 Degrees conferred between July 1, 2016 and June 30, 2017
J1 For each of the following discipline areas, provide the percentage of diplomas/certificates, associate, and bachelor's degrees awarded. To determine the percentage, use majors, not headcount (e.g., students with one degree but a double major will be represented twice). Calculate the percentage from your institution's IPEDS Completions by using the sum of 1st and 2nd majors for each CIP code as the numerator and the sum of the Grand Total by 1st Majors and the Grand Total by 2nd major as the denominator. If you prefer, you can compute the percentages using 1st majors only.

Financial need: As determined by your institution using the federal methodology and/or your institution's own standards.
Need-based aid: College-funded or college-administered award from institutional, state, federal, or other sources for which a student must have financial need to qualify. This includes both institutional and noninstitutional student aid (grants, jobs, and loans).
Need-based scholarship or grant aid: Scholarships and grants from institutional, state, federal, or other sources for which a student must have financial need to qualify.
Need-based self-help aid: Loans and jobs from institutional, state, federal, or other sources for which a student must demonstrate financial need to qualify.
Non-need-based scholarship or grant aid: Scholarships and grants, gifts, or merit-based aid from institutional, state, federal, or other sources (including unrestricted funds or gifts and endowment income) awarded solely on the basis of academic achievement, merit, or any other non-need-based reason. When reporting questions H 1 and H 2 , non-need-based aid that is used to meet need should be counted as needbased aid.
Note: Suggested order of precedence for counting non-need money as need-based:
Non-need institutional grants
Non-need tuition waivers
Non-need athletic awards
Non-need federal grants
Non-need state grants
Non-need outside grants
Non-need student loans
Non-need parent loans
Non-need work
Non-need-based self-help aid: Loans and jobs from institutional, state, or other sources for which a student need not demonstrate financial need to qualify.
Private student loans: A nonfederal loan made by a lender such as a bank, credit union or private lender used to pay for up to the annual cost of education, less any financial aid received.
Work study and employment: Federal and state work study aid, and any employment packaged by your institution in financial aid awards.
