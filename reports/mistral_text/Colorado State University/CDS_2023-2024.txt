# B22. Retention Rates 

Report for the cohort of all full-time, first-time bachelor's (or equivalent) degree-seeking undergraduate students who entered in Fall 2022 (or the preceding summer term).

The initial cohort may be adjusted for students who departed for the following reasons:
*Death
*Rermanent Disability
*Service in the armed forces
*Foreign aid service of the federal government
*Official church missions
*No other adjustments to the initial cohort should be made.
For the cohort of all full-time bachelor's (or equivalent) degree-seeking undergraduate students who entered your institution as first-year students in Fall 2022 (or the preceding summer term), what percentage was enrolled at your institution as of the date your institution calculates its official enrollment in Fall 2023.

Total students retained = students from the Fall 2022 cohort who are still enrolled as of Fall 2023 + students from Fall 2022 cohort who completed their bachelor's program as of Fall 2023
(Students from the Fall 2022 cohort still enrolled as of Fall 2023 + Students from Fall 2022 cohort who completed their bachelor's program as of Fall 2023)/(Adjusted Fall 2022 cohort) *100

Note: The number of first-time students seeking a bachelor's degree (or equivalent) who attain a bachelor's degree (or equivalent) by their second fall term is expected to be zero or very small. In exceptional cases when a first-time student does satisfy all degree requirements including full credit completion (e.g., typically 120 credit hours) and is awarded a bachelor's degree (or equivalent) by their second fall term, they are to be considered "retained" for EF reporting purposes.
# C. FIRST-TIME, FIRST-YEAR ADMISSION 

## C1. Applications: First-time, First-year Students

Provide the number of degree-seeking, first-time, first-year students who applied, were admitted, and enrolled (full- or part-time) in Fall 2023.

- Include early decision, early action, and students who began studies during summer in this cohort.
- Applicants should include only those students who fulfilled the requirements for consideration for admission (i.e., who completed actionable applications) and who have been notified of one of the following actions: admission, non-admission, placement on waiting list, or application withdrawn (by applicant or institution).
- Admitted applicants should include wait-listed students who were subsequently offered admission.
- Since the total may include students who did not provide gender data, the detail need not sum to the total.
- If your institution collects and reports non-binary gender data, please use the "Another Gender" category.
- Note that recent high school graduates and other students without prior postsecondary experience will still be considered "first-time students" for fall enrollment reporting purposes even if they enrolled in the summer prior to fall enrollment.

Indebtedness: Aggregate dollar amount borrowed through any loan program (federal, state, subsidized, unsubsidized, private, etc.; excluding parent loans) while the student was enrolled at an institution. Student loans co-signed by a parent are assumed to be the responsibility of the student and should be included.

Institutional scholarships and grants: Endowed scholarships, annual gifts and tuition funded grants for which the institution determines the recipient.
Financial need: As determined by your institution using the federal methodology and/or your institution's own standards.
Need-based aid: College-funded or college-administered award from institutional, state, federal, or other sources for which a student must have financial need to qualify. This includes both institutional and non-institutional student aid (grants, jobs, and loans).

Need-based scholarship or grant aid: Scholarships and grants from institutional, state, federal, or other sources for which a student must have financial need to qualify.

Need-based self-help aid: Loans and jobs from institutional, state, federal, or other sources for which a student must demonstrate financial need to qualify.
Non-need-based scholarship or grant aid: Scholarships and grants, gifts, or merit-based aid from institutional, state, federal, or other sources (including unrestricted funds or gifts and endowment income) awarded solely on the basis of academic achievement, merit, or any other non-need-based reason. When reporting questions H1 and H2, non-need-based aid that is used to meet need should be counted as need-based aid.

Note: Suggested order of precedence for counting non-need money as need-based:

1.Non-need institutional grants
2.Non-need tuition waivers
3.Non-need athletic awards
4.Non-need federal grants
5.Non-need state grants
6. Non-need outside grants
7. Non-need student loans
8. Non-need parent loans
9. Non-need work

Non-need-based self-help aid: Loans and jobs from institutional, state, or other sources for which a student need not demonstrate financial need to qualify.
Private student loans: A nonfederal loan made by a lender such as a bank, credit union or private lender used to pay for up to the annual cost of education, less any financial aid received.

External scholarships and grants: Scholarships and grants received from outside (private) sources that students bring with them (e.g., Kiwanis, National Merit scholarships). The institution may process paperwork to receive the dollars, but it has no role in determining the recipient or the dollar amount awarded.

Work study and employment: Federal and state work study aid, and any employment packaged by your institution in financial aid awards.

# I. INSTRUCTIONAL FACULTY AND CLASS SIZE 

## I1. Instructional Faculty by Category

Please report the number of instructional faculty members in each category for Fall 2023. Include faculty who are on your institution's payroll on the census date your institution uses for IPEDS/AAUP.

The following definition of full-time instructional faculty is used by the American Association of University Professors (AAUP) in its annual Faculty Compensation Survey (the part time definitions are not used by AAUP). Instructional Faculty is defined as those members of the instructional-research staff whose major regular assignment is instruction, including those with released time for research. Use the chart below to determine inclusions and exclusions:

|  | Full-Time | Part-Time |
| :-- | :--: | :--: |
| A. Instructional faculty in preclinical and clinical medicine, faculty who are not paid <br> (e.g., those who donate their services or are in the military), or research-only <br> faculty, post-doctoral fellows, or pre-doctoral fellows | Exclude | Include only if they teach <br> one or more non-clinical <br> credit courses |
| B. Administrative officers with titles such as dean of students, librarian, registrar, <br> coach, and the like, even though they may devote part of their time to classroom <br> instruction and may have faculty status | Exclude | Include only if they teach <br> one or more non-clinical <br> credit courses |
| C. Other administrators/staff who teach one or more non-clinical credit courses <br> even though they do not have faculty status | Exclude | Include |

Full-time instructional faculty: faculty employed on a full-time basis for instruction (including those with released time for research).

Part-time instructional faculty: Adjuncts and other instructors being paid solely for part-time classroom instruction. Also includes full-time faculty teaching less than two semesters, three quarters, two trimesters, or two four-month sessions. Employees who are not considered fulltime instruction faculty but who teach one or more non-clinical credit courses may be counted as part-time faculty.

Minority faculty : includes faculty who designate themselves as Black, non-Hispanic; American Indian or Alaska Native; Asian, Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander, or Hispanic.

Doctorate: includes such degrees as Doctor of Philosophy, Doctor of Education, Doctor of Juridical Science, and Doctor of Public Health in any field such as arts, sciences, education, engineering, business, and public administration.

# 13. Undergraduate Class Size 

In the table below, please report information about the size of classes and class sections offered in the Fall 2023 term.

Class Sections: A class section is an organized course offered for credit, identified by discipline and number, meeting at a stated time or times in a classroom or similar setting, and not a subsection such as a laboratory or discussion session. Undergraduate class sections are defined as any sections in which at least one degree-seeking undergraduate student is enrolled for credit. Exclude distance learning classes and noncredit classes and individual instruction such as dissertation or thesis research, music instruction, or one-to-one readings. Exclude students in independent study, co-operative programs, internships, foreign language taped tutor sessions, practicums, and all students in one-on-one classes. Each class section should be counted only once and should not be duplicated because of course catalog cross-listings.

Class Subsections: A class subsection includes any subsection of a course, such as laboratory, recitation, and discussion subsections that are supplementary in nature and are scheduled to meet separately from the lecture portion of the course. Undergraduate subsections are defined as any subsections of courses in which degree-seeking undergraduate students enrolled for credit. As above, exclude noncredit classes and individual instruction such as dissertation or thesis research, music instruction, or one-to-one readings. Each class subsection should be counted only once and should not be duplicated because of cross-listings.

Using the above definitions, please report for each of the following class-size intervals the number of class sections and class subsections offered in Fall 2023. For example, a lecture class with 800 students who met at another time in 40 separate labs with 20 students should be counted once in the "100+" column in the class section column and 40 times under the "20-29" column of the class subsections table.

# J. DISCIPLINARY AREAS of DEGREES CONFERRED 

## Degrees conferred between July 1, 2022 and June 30, 2023.

For each of the following discipline areas, provide the percentage of diplomas/certificates, associate, and bachelor's degrees awarded. To determine the percentage, use majors, not headcount (e.g., students with one degree but a double major will be represented twice). Calculate the percentage from your institution's IPEDS Completions by using the sum of $1^{\text {st }}$ and $2^{\text {nd }}$ majors for each CIP code as the numerator and the sum of the Grand Total by 1st Majors and the Grand Total by $2^{\text {nd }}$ major as the denominator. If you prefer, you can compute the percentages using $1^{\text {st }}$ majors only.

External scholarships and grants: Scholarships and grants received from outside (private) sources that students bring with them (e.g., Kiwanis, National Merit scholarships). The institution may process paperwork to receive the dollars, but it has no role in determining the recipient or the dollar amount awarded.

Indebtedness: Aggregate dollar amount borrowed through any loan program (federal, state, subsidized, unsubsidized, private, etc.; excluding parent loans) while the student was enrolled at an institution. Student loans co-signed by a parent are assumed to be the responsibility of the student and should be included.

Institutional scholarships and grants: Endowed scholarships, annual gifts and tuition funded grants for which the institution determines the recipient.

Financial need: As determined by your institution using the federal methodology and/or your institution's own standards.
