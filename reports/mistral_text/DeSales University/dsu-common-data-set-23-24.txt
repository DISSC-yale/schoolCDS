# B22. Retention Rates 

Report for the cohort of all full-time, first-time bachelor's (or equivalent) degree-seeking undergraduate students who entered in Fall 2022 (or the preceding summer term).

The initial cohort may be adjusted for students who departed for the following reasons: Death, permanent disability, service in the armed forces, foreign aid service of the federal government, or official church missions. No other adjustments to the initial cohort should be made.

For the cohort of all full-time bachelor's (or equivalent) degree-seeking undergraduate students who entered your institution as first-year students in Fall 2022 (or the preceding summer term), what percentage was enrolled at your institution as of the date your institution calculates its official enrollment in Fall 2023.

Total students retained = students from the Fall 2022 cohort who are still enrolled as of Fall 2023 + students from Fall 2022 cohort who completed their bachelor's program as of Fall 2023
(Students from the Fall 2022 cohort still enrolled as of Fall 2023 + Students from Fall 2022 cohort who completed their bachelor's program as of Fall 2023)/(Adjusted Fall 2022 cohort) *100

Note: The number of first-time students seeking a bachelor's degree (or equivalent) who attain a bachelor's degree (or equivalent) by their second fall term is expected to be zero or very small. In exceptional cases when a first-time student does satisfy all degree requirements including full credit completion (e.g., typically 120 credit hours) and is awarded a bachelor's degree (or equivalent) by their second fall term, they are to be considered "retained" for EF reporting purposes.

# H. FINANCIAL AID 

Please refer to the following financial aid definitions when completing Section H.
Awarded aid: The dollar amounts offered to financial aid applicants.
Financial aid applicant: Any applicant who submits any one of the institutionally required financial aid applications/forms, such as the FAFSA.
Indebtedness: Aggregate dollar amount borrowed through any loan program (federal, state, subsidized, unsubsidized, private, etc.; excluding parent loans) while the student was enrolled at an institution. Student loans co-signed by a parent are assumed to be the responsibility of the student and should be included.
Institutional scholarships and grants: Endowed scholarships, annual gifts and tuition funded grants for which the institution determines the recipient.
Financial need: As determined by your institution using the federal methodology and/or your institution's own standards.
Need-based aid: College-funded or college-administered award from institutional, state, federal, or other sources for which a student must have financial need to qualify. This includes both institutional and non-institutional student aid (grants, jobs, and loans).
Need-based scholarship or grant aid: Scholarships and grants from institutional, state, federal, or other sources for which a student must have financial need to qualify.
Need-based self-help aid: Loans and jobs from institutional, state, federal, or other sources for which a student must demonstrate financial need to qualify.
Non-need-based scholarship or grant aid: Scholarships and grants, gifts, or merit-based aid from institutional, state, federal, or other sources (including unrestricted funds or gifts and endowment income) awarded solely on the basis of academic achievement, merit, or any other non-need-based reason. When reporting questions H 1 and H 2 , non-need-based aid that is used to meet need should be counted as need-based aid.

Note: Suggested order of precedence for counting non-need money as need-based:
1.Non-need institutional grants
2. Non-need tuition waivers
3. Non-need athletic awards
4. Non-need federal grants
6. Non-need outside grants
7. Non-need student loans
8. Non-need parent loans
9. Non-need work
5. Non-need state grants

Non-need-based self-help aid: Loans and jobs from institutional, state, or other sources for which a student need not demonstrate financial need to qualify.
Private student loans: A nonfederal loan made by a lender such as a bank, credit union or private lender used to pay for up to the annual cost of education, less any financial aid received.
External scholarships and grants: Scholarships and grants received from outside (private) sources that students bring with them (e.g., Kiwanis, National Merit scholarships). The institution may process paperwork to receive the dollars, but it has no role in determining the recipient or the dollar amount awarded.
Work study and employment: Federal and state work study aid, and any employment packaged by your institution in financial aid awards.

## H1. Aid Awarded to Enrolled Undergraduates

Enter total dollar amounts awarded to enrolled full-time and less than full-time degree-seeking undergraduates (using the same cohort reported in CDS Question B1, "total degree-seeking" undergraduates) in the following categories.

Include aid awarded to international students (i.e., those not qualifying for federal aid).
Aid that is non-need-based but that was used to meet need should be reported in the need-based aid column.
For a suggested order of precedence in assigning categories of aid to cover need, see the entry for "non-needbased scholarship or grant aid" on the last page of the definitions section.

Do NOT include any aid related to the CARES Act or unique to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Provide the number and percent of students in class (defined in H4 above) borrowing from federal, non-federal, and any loan sources, and the average (or mean) amount borrowed in the table below.

The "average per-undergraduate-borrower cumulative principal borrowed" is designed to provide better information about student borrowing from federal and nonfederal (institutional, state, commercial) sources.

The numbers, percentages, and averages for each row should be based only on the loan source specific for the particular row. For example, the federal loans average (Row B) should only be the cumulative average of federal loans and the private loans average (Row E) should only the cumulative average of private loans.

| Source/Type of Loan | Number in the class (defined in H4 above) who borrowed from the types of loans specific in the first column | Percent of the class (defined above) who borrowed from the types of loans specified in the first column (nearest 1\%) | Average per- <br> undergraduateborrower cumulative principal borrowed from the types of loans specific in the first column (nearest \$1) |

# I. INSTRUCTIONAL FACULTY AND CLASS SIZE 

## I1. Instructional Faculty by Category

Please report the number of instructional faculty members in each category for Fall 2023. Include faculty who are on your institution's payroll on the census date your institution uses for IPEDS/AAUP.

The following definition of full-time instructional faculty is used by the American Association of University Professors (AAUP) in its annual Faculty Compensation Survey (the part time definitions are not used by AAUP). Instructional Faculty is defined as those members of the instructional-research staff whose major regular assignment is instruction, including those with released time for research. Use the chart below to determine inclusions and exclusions:

|  | Full-Time | Part-Time |
| :--: | :--: | :--: |
| A. Instructional faculty in preclinical and clinical medicine, faculty who are not paid <br> (e.g., those who donate their services or are in the military), or research-only <br> faculty, post-doctoral fellows, or pre-doctoral fellows | Exclude | Include only if they teach <br> one or more non-clinical <br> credit courses |
| B. Administrative officers with titles such as dean of students, librarian, registrar, <br> coach, and the like, even though they may devote part of their time to classroom <br> instruction and may have faculty status | Exclude | Include only if they teach <br> one or more non-clinical <br> credit courses |
| C. Other administrators/staff who teach one or more non-clinical credit courses <br> even though they do not have faculty status | Exclude | Include |
| D. Undergraduate or graduate students who assist in the instruction of courses, <br> but have titles such as teaching assistant, teaching fellow, and the like | Exclude | Exclude |
| E. Faculty on sabbatical or leave with pay | Include | Exclude |
| F. Faculty on leave without pay | Exclude | Exclude |
| G. Replacement faculty for faculty on sabbatical leave or leave with pay | Exclude | Include |

Full-time instructional faculty: faculty employed on a full-time basis for instruction (including those with released time for research).

Part-time instructional faculty: Adjuncts and other instructors being paid solely for part-time classroom instruction. Also includes full-time faculty teaching less than two semesters, three quarters, two trimesters, or two four-month sessions. Employees who are not considered fulltime instruction faculty but who teach one or more non-clinical credit courses may be counted as part-time faculty.

Minority faculty : includes faculty who designate themselves as Black, non-Hispanic; American Indian or Alaska Native; Asian, Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander, or Hispanic.

Doctorate: includes such degrees as Doctor of Philosophy, Doctor of Education, Doctor of Juridical Science, and Doctor of Public Health in any field such as arts, sciences, education, engineering, business, and public administration. Also includes terminal degrees formerly designated as "first professional," including dentistry (DDS or DMD), medicine (MD), optometry (OD), osteopathic medicine (DO), pharmacy (DPharm or BPharm), podiatric medicine (DPM), veterinary medicine (DVM), chiropractic (DC or DCM), or law (JD).

Terminal master's degree: a master's degree that is considered the highest degree in a field: example, M. Arch (in architecture) and MFA (master of fine arts in art or theater).

|  | Full-Time | Part-Time | Total |
| :-- | :--: | :--: | :--: |
| A. Total number of instructional faculty | 137 | 272 | 409 |
| B. Total number who are members of minority groups | 15 | 8 | 23 |
| C. Total number who are women | 79 | 156 | 235 |
| D. Total number who are men | 58 | 101 | 159 |
| E. Total number who are international (non-residents) | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| F. Total number with decorate, or other terminal degrees | 122 | -- | -- |
| G. Total number whose highest degree is a master's degree but not a terminal <br> master's | 15 | -- | -- |
| H. Total number whose highest degree is a bachelor's | 0 | -- | -- |
| I. Total number whose highest degree is unknown or other | 0 | -- | -- |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| J. Total number in stand-alone graduate/professional programs in which faculty <br> teach virtually only graduate-level students | 23 | -- | -- |

NOTE: Rows F, G, H and I should equal row A.

# I2. Student to Faculty Ratio 

Report the Fall 2023 ratio of full-time equivalent students (full-time plus 1/3 part time) to full-time equivalent instructional faculty (full time plus $1 / 3$ part time). In the ratio calculations, exclude both faculty and students in stand-alone graduate or professional programs such as medicine, law, veterinary, dentistry, social work, business, or public health in which faculty teach virtually only graduate level students.

Do not count undergraduate or graduate student teaching assistants as faculty.

|  | Fall 2023 Student to Faculty Ratio: | 11 | to | 1 |
| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |
| Ratio is based on number of students: | 2,299 |  |  |  |
| Ratio is based on number of faculty: | 205 |  |  |  |

## I3. Undergraduate Class Size

In the table below, please report information about the size of classes and class sections offered in the Fall 2023 term.
Class Sections: A class section is an organized course offered for credit, identified by discipline and number, meeting at a stated time or times in a classroom or similar setting, and not a subsection such as a laboratory or discussion session. Undergraduate class sections are defined as any sections in which at least one degree-seeking undergraduate student is enrolled for credit. Exclude distance learning classes and noncredit classes and individual instruction such as dissertation or thesis research, music instruction, or one-to-one readings. Exclude students in independent study, co-operative programs, internships, foreign language taped tutor sessions, practicums, and all students in one-on-one classes. Each class section should be counted only once and should not be duplicated because of course catalog cross-listings.

Class Subsections: A class subsection includes any subsection of a course, such as laboratory, recitation, and discussion subsections that are supplementary in nature and are scheduled to meet separately from the lecture portion of the course. Undergraduate subsections are defined as any subsections of courses in which degree-seeking undergraduate students enrolled for credit. As above, exclude noncredit classes and individual instruction such as dissertation or thesis research, music instruction, or one-to-one readings. Each class subsection should be counted only once and should not be duplicated because of cross-listings.

Using the above definitions, please report for each of the following class-size intervals the number of class sections and class subsections offered in Fall 2023. For example, a lecture class with 800 students who met at another time in 40 separate labs with 20 students should be counted once in the "100+" column in the class section column and 40 times under the "20-29" column of the class subsections table.

| Number of class sections with undergraduates enrolled - <br> Undergraduate Class Size (provide numbers) | Class <br> Sections | Class Sub- <br> Sections |
| :--: | :--: | :--: |
|  | 110 | 55 |
| $\mathbf{2 - 9}$ | 180 | 27 |

# J. DISCIPLINARY AREAS of DEGREES CONFERRED 

Degrees conferred between July 1, 2022 and June 30, 2023.
For each of the following discipline areas, provide the percentage of diplomas/certificates, associate, and bachelor's degrees awarded. To determine the percentage, use majors, not headcount (e.g., students with one degree but a double major will be represented twice). Calculate the percentage from your institution's IPEDS Completions by using the sum of $1^{\text {st }}$ and $2^{\text {nd }}$ majors for each CIP code as the numerator and the sum of the Grand Total by 1st Majors and the Grand Total by $2^{\text {nd }}$ major as the denominator. If you prefer, you can compute the percentages using $1^{\text {st }}$ majors only.
