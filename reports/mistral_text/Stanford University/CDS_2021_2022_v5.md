## B4-B21: Graduation Rates

The items in this section correspond to data elements collected by the IPEDS Web-based Data Collection System's Graduation Rate Survey (GRS).

- For complete instructions and definitions of data elements, see the IPEDS GRS Forms and Instructions for the 2021-2022 Survey. https://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/use-the-data/survey-components/9/graduation-rates

In the following section for bachelor's or equivalent programs, please disaggregate the Fall 2014 and Fall 2015 cohorts (formerly CDS B4-B11) into four groups:

- Students who received a Federal Pell Grant*
- Recipients of a subsidized Stafford Loan who did not receive a Pell Grant
- Students who did not receive either a Pell Grant or a subsidized Stafford Loan
- Total (all students, regardless of Pell Grant or subsidized loan status)
*Students who received both a Federal Pell Grant and a subsidized Stafford Loan should be reported in the "Recipients of a Federal Pell Grant" column.

For each graduation rate grid below, the numbers in the first three columns for Questions A-G should sum to the cohort total in the fourth column (formerly CDS B4-B11).

G1 Undergraduate full-time tuition, required fees, room and board
List the typical tuition, required fees, and room and board for a full-time undergraduate student for the FULL 2022-2023 academic year. ( 30 semester hours or 45 quarter hours for institutions that derive annual tuition by multiplying credit hour cost by number of credits).

- A full academic year refers to the period of time generally extending from September to June; usually equated to two semesters, two trimesters, three quarters, or the period covered by a four-one-four plan.
- Room and board is defined as double occupancy and 19 meals per week or the maximum meal plan.
- Required fees include only charges that all full-time students must pay that are not included in tuition (e.g., registration, health, or activity fees.)
- Do not include optional fees (e.g., parking, laboratory use).

# H. FINANCIAL AID 

## Please refer to the following financial aid definitions when completing Section H.

Awarded aid: The dollar amounts offered to financial aid applicants.
Financial aid applicant: Any applicant who submits any one of the institutionally required financial aid applications/forms, such as the FAFSA.

Indebtedness: Aggregate dollar amount borrowed through any loan program (federal, state, subsidized, unsubsidized, private, etc.; excluding parent loans) while the student was enrolled at an institution. Student loans co-signed by a parent are assumed to be the responsibility of the student and should be included.

Institutional scholarships and grants: Endowed scholarships, annual gifts and tuition funded grants for which the institution determines the recipient.

Financial need: As determined by your institution using the federal methodology and/or your institution's own standards.

Need-based aid: College-funded or college-administered award from institutional, state, federal, or other sources for which a student must have financial need to qualify. This includes both institutional and non-institutional student aid (grants, jobs, and loans).

Need-based scholarship or grant aid: Scholarships and grants from institutional, state, federal, or other sources for which a student must have financial need to qualify.

Need-based self-help aid: Loans and jobs from institutional, state, federal, or other sources for which a student must demonstrate financial need to qualify.

Non-need-based scholarship or grant aid: Scholarships and grants, gifts, or merit-based aid from institutional, state, federal, or other sources (including unrestricted funds or gifts and endowment income) awarded solely on the basis of academic achievement, merit, or any other non-need-based reason. When reporting questions H1 and H2, non-need-based aid that is used to meet need should be counted as need-based aid.

Note: Suggested order of precedence for counting non-need money as need-based:

1. Non-need institutional grants
2. Non-need tuition waivers
3. Non-need athletic awards
4. Non-need federal grants
5. Non-need state grants

Non-need-out self-help aid: Loans and jobs from institutional, state, or other sources for which a student need not demonstrate financial need to qualify.

Private student loans: A nonfederal loan made by a lender such as a bank, credit union or private lender used to pay for up to the annual cost of education, less any financial aid received.

External scholarships and grants: Scholarships and grants received from outside (private) sources that students bring with them (e.g., Kiwanis, National Merit scholarships). The institution may process paperwork to receive the dollars, but it has no role in determining the recipient or the dollar amount awarded.

Work study and employment: Federal and state work study aid, and any employment packaged by your institution in financial aid awards.

## Aid Awarded to Enrolled Undergraduates

H1 Enter total dollar amounts awarded to enrolled full-time and less than full-time degree-seeking undergraduates (using the same cohort reported in CDS Question B1, "total degree-seeking" undergraduates) in the following categories.

- If the data being reported are final figures for the 2020-2021 academic year (see the next item below), use the 2020-2021 academic year's CDS Question B1 cohort.
- Include aid awarded to international students (i.e., those not qualifying for federal aid).
- Aid that is non-need-based but that was used to meet need should be reported in the need-based aid column.
- For a suggested order of precedence in assigning categories of aid to cover need, see the entry for "non-need-based scholarship or grant aid" on the last page of the definitions section.

# I. INSTRUCTIONAL FACULTY AND CLASS SIZE 

## I-1. Please report the number of instructional faculty members in each category for Fall 2021. Include faculty who are on your institution's payroll on the census date your institution uses for IPEDS/AAUP.

The following definition of full-time instructional faculty is used by the American Association of University Professors (AAUP) in its annual Faculty Compensation Survey (the part time definitions are not used by AAUP). Instructional Faculty is defined as those members of the instructional-research staff whose major regular assignment is instruction, including those with released time for research. Use the chart below to determine inclusions and exclusions:

|  |  | Full-time | Part-time |
| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |
| A | Instructional faculty in preclinical and clinical medicine, faculty who are not paid (e.g., those who donate their services or are in the military), or research-only faculty, post-doctoral fellows, or pre-doctoral fellows | Exclude | Include only if they teach one or more non-clinical credit courses |
| B | Administrative officers with titles such as dean of students, librarian, registrar, coach, and the like, even though they may devote part of their time to classroom instruction and may have faculty status | Exclude | Include if they teach one or more non-clinical credit courses |
| C | Other administrators/staff who teach one or more non-clinical credit courses even though they do not have faculty status | Exclude | Include |
| D | Undergraduate or graduate students who assist in the instruction of courses, but have titles such as teaching assistant, teaching fellow, and the like | Exclude | Exclude |
| E | Faculty on sabbatical or leave with pay | Include | Exclude |

Full-time instructional faculty: faculty employed on a full-time basis for instruction (including those with released time for research)

Part-time instructional faculty: Adjuncts and other instructors being paid solely for part-time classroom instruction. Also includes full-time faculty teaching less than two semesters, three quarters, two trimesters, or two four-month sessions. Employees who are not considered full-time instruction faculty but who teach one or more non-clinical credit courses may be counted as part-time faculty.

Minority faculty: includes faculty who designate themselves as Black, non-Hispanic; American Indian or Alaska Native; Asian, Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander, or Hispanic.

Doctorate: includes such degrees as Doctor of Philosophy, Doctor of Education, Doctor of Juridical Science, and Doctor of Public Health in any field such as arts, sciences, education, engineering, business, and public administration. Also includes terminal degrees formerly designated as "first professional," including dentistry (DDS or DMD), medicine (MD), optometry (OD), osteopathic medicine (DO), pharmacy (DPharm or BPharm), podiatric medicine (DPM), veterinary medicine (DVM), chiropractic (DC or DCM), or law (JD).

Terminal master's degree: a master's degree that is considered the highest degree in a field: example, M. Arch (in architecture) and MFA (master of fine arts in art or theater).

## I-3. Undergraduate Class Size

In the table below, please use the following definitions to report information about the size of classes and class sections offered in the Fall 2021 term.
Class Sections: A class section is an organized course offered for credit, identified by discipline and number, meeting at a stated time or times in a classroom or similar setting, and not a subsection such as a laboratory or discussion session. Undergraduate class sections are defined as any sections in which at least one degree-seeking undergraduate student is enrolled for credit. Exclude distance learning classes and noncredit classes and individual instruction such as dissertation or thesis research, music instruction, or one-to-one readings. Exclude students in independent study, co-operative programs, internships, foreign language taped tutor sessions, practicums, and all students in one-on-one classes. Each class section should be counted only once and should not be duplicated because of course catalog cross-listings.

Class Subsections: A class subsection includes any subsection of a course, such as laboratory, recitation, and discussion subsections that are supplementary in nature and are scheduled to meet separately from the lecture portion of the course. Undergraduate subsections are defined as any subsections of courses in which degree-seeking undergraduate students enrolled for credit. As above, exclude noncredit classes and individual instruction such as dissertation or thesis research, music instruction, or one-to-one readings. Each class subsection should be counted only once and should not be duplicated because of cross-listings.

Using the above definitions, please report for each of the following class-size intervals the number of class sections and class subsections offered in Fall 2021. For example, a lecture class with 800 students who met at another time in 40 separate labs with 20 students should be counted once in the " $100+$ " column in the class section column and 40 times under the " $20-29$ " column of the class subsections table.

# J. Disciplinary areas of DEGREES CONFERRED 

J1 Degrees conferred between July 1, 2020 and June 30, 2021
For each of the following discipline areas, provide the percentage of diplomas/certificates, associate, and bachelor's degrees awarded. To determine the percentage, use majors, not headcount (e.g., students with one degree but a double major will be represented twice). Calculate the percentage from your institution's IPEDS Completions by using the sum of 1st and 2nd majors for each CIP code as the numerator and the sum of the Grand Total by 1st Majors and the Grand Total by 2nd major as the denominator. If you prefer, you can compute the percentages using 1st majors only.
