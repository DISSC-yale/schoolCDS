# Stanford University Common Data Set 2008-2009 

The Common Data Set Initiative is a collaborative effort between publishers and the educational community to improve the quality and accuracy of information provided to all involved in a student's transition into higher education, as well as to reduce the burden on colleges of compiling and reporting information. Questions and definitions used by the U.S. Department of Education in its college surveys are a guide in the development of CDS items. Common Data Set items undergo broad review by secondary schools and two-and four-year colleges.

H15. If you institution has recently implemented any major financial aid policy, program or initiative to make your institution more affordable to incoming students, such as replacing loans with grants, or waiving costs for families below a certain income, please provide details below:
*Zero Parent Contribution for Parents with Income Below \$60,000*
For parents with total annual income below $\$ 60,000$ and typical assets for this income range, Stanford will not expect a parent contribution toward educational costs. Students will still be expected to contribute toward their own expenses from their summer income, parttime work during the school year, and their own savings.
*Tuition Charges Covered for Parents with Income Below \$100,000*
For parents with total annual income below $\$ 100,000$ and typical assets for this income range, Stanford will ensure that all tuition charges are covered with need-based scholarship, federal and state grants, and/or outside scholarship funds. In most cases, the parent contribution will be no higher than the standard cost of room and board (around \$11,000). Many parents in this group will see contribution amounts far lower than \$11,000.
*More Generous Method for Determining Family Contributions at all income levels *Our methodology for calculating the expected family contributions for all applicants has been revised to be significantly more generous, while remaining true to the principles of need-based, equitable distribution of funds. Changes include:
* Capping the amount of home equity in the parent asset calculation at 1.2 times the amount of total annual income
* Increasing the portion of total parent assets that are protected against assessment, for most families
* Adjusting the parent income calculation to reflect the higher cost of living in certain parts of the country
* Dividing the total calculated parent contribution evenly among multiple siblings in college
* Decreasing the assessment rate for student assets from 25\% to 5\% per academic year
*Students Not Expected to Borrow to Meet Educational Costs
*Students are no longer expected to borrow student loans as part of their financial aid packages. Students receiving scholarship funds are expected to work part-time during the academic year, with a standard earnings expectation of \$2,500. Students are also expected to contribute from their summer earnings a standard minimum amount of $\$ 2,000$. Students can reduce or eliminate the earnings expectations by obtaining scholarships from outside agencies and organizations. Outside scholarships will reduce the earnings expectations on a dollar-for-dollar basis.

# I. INSTRUCTIONAL FACULTY AND CLASS SIZE 

I-1. Please report number of instructional faculty members in each category for Fall 2008. The following definition of instructional faculty is used by the American Association of University Professors (AAUP) in its annual Faculty Compensation Survey. Instructional Faculty is defined as those members of the instructional-research staff whose major regular assignment is instruction, including those with released time for research. Institutions are asked to EXCLUDE:
(a) instructional faculty in preclinical and clinical medicine
(b) administrative officers with titles such as dean of students, librarian, registrar, coach, and the like, even though they may devote part of their time to classroom instruction and may have faculty status,
(c) other administrators/staff who teach one or more non-clinical credit courses even though they do not have faculty status
(d) faculty on leave with or without without pay,
(e) replacement faculty for faculty on sabbatical leave, and
(f) undergraduate or graduate students who assist in the instruction of courses, but have titles such as teaching assistant, teaching fellow and the like
Full-time: faculty employed on a full-time basis
Part-time: faculty teaching less than two semesters, three quarters, two trimesters, or two four-month sessions. Also includes adjuncts and part-time instructors.
Minority faculty: includes faculty who designate themselves as black, non-Hispanic; American Indian or Alaskan native; Asian or Pacific Islander; or Hispanic.
Doctorate: includes such degrees as Doctor of Education, Doctor of Juridical Science, Doctor of Public Health, and Doctor of Philosophy in any field such as arts, sciences, education, engineering, business, and public administration. Also includes terminal degrees formerly designated as "first professional," such as dentistry, medicine, optometry,
osteropathic medicine, pharmacy, podiatric medicine, veterinary medicine, chiropractic or law.
Terminal degree: the highest degree in a field: example, M. Arch (architecture) and MFA (master of fine arts).

|  | Full-time | Part-time | Total |
| :-- | :--: | :--: | :--: |
| Total number of instructional faculty | 984 | 18 | 1,002 |
| Total number who are members of minority groups | 182 | 0 | 182 |
| Total number who are women | 240 | 1 | 241 |
| Total number who are men | 744 | 17 | 761 |
| Total number who are nonresident aliens | $\mathrm{n} / \mathrm{a}$ | $\mathrm{n} / \mathrm{a}$ | $\mathrm{n} / \mathrm{a}$ |
| Total number with doctorate, first professional, <br> or other terminal degree | 968 | 15 | 983 |
| Total number whose highest degree is <br> a master's but not a terminal master's | 11 | 3 | 14 |
| Total number whose highest degree is a bachelor's | 4 | 0 | 4 |
| Total number whose highest degree is unknown or other | 1 | 0 | 1 |
| Total number in stand-alone graduate/professional <br> programs in which faculty teach virtually only graduate students | 191 | 1 | 192 |

# I-2. Student to Faculty Ratio 

Report the Fall 2008 ratio of full-time equivalent students (full-time plus $1 / 3$ part time) to fulltime equivalent instructional faculty (full time plus $1 / 3$ part time). In the ratio calculations, exclude both faculty and students in stand-alone graduate or professional programs such as medicine, law, veterinary, dentistry, social work, business, or public health in which faculty teach virtually only graduate level students. Do not count undergraduate or graduate student teaching assistants as faculty.

Fall 2008 Student to Faculty ratio: 6.4 to 1 (based on 6,812 students and 1,061 faculty)

## I-3. Undergraduate Class Size

In the table below, please use the following definitions to report information about the size of classes and class sections offered in the Fall 2008 term.

Class Sections: A class section is an organized course offered for credit, identified by discipline and number, meeting at a stated time or times in a classroom or similar setting, and not a subsection such as a laboratory or discussion session. Undergraduate class sections are defined as any sections in which at least one degree-seeking undergraduate
student is enrolled for credit. Exclude distance learning classes and noncredit classes and individual instruction such as dissertation or thesis research, music instruction, or one-toone readings. Exclude students in independent study, co-operative programs, internships, foreign language taped tutor sessions, practicums, and all students in one-on-one classes. Each class section should be counted only once and should not be duplicated because of course catalog cross-listings.

Class Subsections: A class subsection includes any subsection of a course, such as laboratory, recitation, and discussion subsections that are supplementary in nature and are scheduled to meet separately from the lecture portion of the course. Undergraduate subsections are defined as any subsections of courses in which degree-seeking undergraduate students enrolled for credit. As above, exclude noncredit classes and individual instruction such as dissertation or thesis research, music instruction, or one-toone readings. Each class subsection should be counted only once and should not be duplicated because of cross-listings.
