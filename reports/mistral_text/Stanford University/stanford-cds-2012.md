# Stanford University Common Data Set 2012-2013 

The Common Data Set (CDS) initiative is a collaborative effort among data providers in the higher education community and publishers as represented by the College Board, Peterson's, and U.S. News \& World Report. The combined goal of this collaboration is to improve the quality and accuracy of information provided to all involved in a student's transition into higher education, as well as to reduce the reporting burden on data providers.

This goal is attained by the development of clear, standard data items and definitions in order to determine a specific cohort relevant to each item. Data items and definitions used by the U.S. Department of Education in its higher education surveys often serve as a guide in the continued development of the CDS. Common Data Set items undergo broad review by the CDS Advisory Board as well as by data providers representing secondary schools and two- and four-year colleges.

H14. Athletic aid is the only non-need based institutional aid awarded at Stanford.
H15. If you institution has recently implemented any major financial aid policy, program or initiative to make your institution more affordable to incoming students, such as replacing
loans with grants, or waiving costs for families below a certain income, please provide details below:
"Zero Parent Contribution for Parents with Income Below \$60,000
For parents with total annual income below $\$ 60,000$ and typical assets for this income range, Stanford will not expect a parent contribution toward educational costs. Students will still be expected to contribute toward their own expenses from their summer income, parttime work during the school year, and their own savings.

Tuition Charges Covered for Parents with Income Below \$100,000
For parents with total annual income below $\$ 100,000$ and typical assets for this income range, the expected parent contribution will be low enough to ensure that all tuition charges are covered with need-based scholarship, federal and state grants, and/or outside scholarship funds.

Families with incomes at higher levels (typically up to $\$ 200,000$ ) may also qualify for assistance, especially if more than one family member is enrolled in college. We encourage any family concerned about the ability to pay for a Stanford education to complete the application process. If we are not able to offer need-based scholarship funds we will recommend available loan programs.

# I. INSTRUCTIONAL FACULTY AND CLASS SIZE 

I-1. Report number of instructional faculty members in each category for Fall 2012. Include faculty who are on your institution's payroll on the census date your institution uses for IPEDS/AAUP.
The following definition of instructional faculty is used by the American Association of University Professors (AAUP) in its annual Faculty Compensation Survey (the part-time definitions are not used by AAUP). Instructional Faculty is defined as those members of the instructional-research staff whose major regular assignment is instruction, including those with released time for research. Use the directions below to determine inclusions and exclusions:
(a) exclude full-time instructional faculty in preclinical and clinical medicine, faculty who are not paid or research-only faculty, post-doctoral fellows or pre-doctoral fellows; include parttime only if they teach one or more non-clinical credit courses
(b) exclude administrative officers with titles such as dean of students, librarian, registrar, coach and the like, even though they may devote part of their time to classroom instruction and may have faculty status; include part time if they teach one or more non-clinical credit courses
(c) exclude other administrators/staff who teach one or more non-clinical credit courses even though they do not have faculty status; include if they are part time
(d) exclude undergraduate or graduate students who assist in the instruction of courses, but have titles such as teaching assistant, teaching fellow and the like; exclude if they are part time
(e) include full-time faculty on sabbatical or leave with pay; exclude them if they are part time
(f) exclude full-time faculty on leave without pay; also exclude part-time faculty on leave without pay
(g) exclude full-time replacement faculty for faculty on sabbatical leave or leave with pay; include if they are part time

Full-time instructional faculty: faculty employed on a full-time basis for instruction, including those with released time for research

Part-time instructional faculty: Adjuncts and other instructors being paid solely for part-time classroom instruction. Also
includes full-time faculty teaching less than two semesters, three quarters, two trimesters or two four-month sessions.

Employees who are not considered full-time instruction faculty but who teach one or more non-clinical credit courses may
be counted as part-time faculty.
Minority faculty: includes faculty who designate themselves as black, non-Hispanic; American Indian or Alaskan native; Asian, Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander; or Hispanic.

Doctorate: includes such degrees as Doctor of Philosophy, Doctor of Education, Doctor of Juridical Science, and Doctor of
Public Health in any field such as arts, sciences, education, engineering, business, and public administration. Also includes
terminal degrees formerly designated as "first professional," including dentistry (DDS or DMD), medicine (MD), optometry
(OD), osteopathic medicine (DO), pharmacy (DPharm or BPharm), podiatric medicine (DPM), veterinary medicine (DVM),
chiropractic (DC or DCM) or law (JD).
Terminal master's degree:a master's degree that is considered the highest degree in a field: example, M. Arch (in
architecture) and MFA (master of fine arts in art or theater).

|  | Full-time | Part-time | Total |
| --: | --: | --: | --: |

# I-2. Student to Faculty Ratio 

Report the Fall 2012 ratio of full-time equivalent students (full-time plus $1 / 3$ part time) to fulltime equivalent instructional faculty (full time plus $1 / 3$ part time). In the ratio calculations, exclude both faculty and students in stand-alone graduate or professional programs such as medicine, law, veterinary, dentistry, social work, business, or public health in which faculty teach virtually only graduate level students. Do not count undergraduate or graduate student teaching assistants as faculty.
Fall 2012 Student to Faculty ratio: 5 to 1 (based on 6,999 students and 1,498 faculty*)

## Please Note:

* Stanford faculty count includes the ranks of professor, associate professor, assistant professor (including parenthetical teaching and performance faculty), instructors, senior lecturers and lecturers. Faculty in graduate schools (business, education, law, medicine) are included if they taught undergraduates during 2012. Lecturers, senior lecturers and instructors are counted on an FTE basis.
* Stanford total faculty includes all tenure-line and parenthetical teaching and performance faculty, as well as those Medical Center Line faculty who taught undergraduates during 2012.
* Stanford stand-alone graduate faculty includes faculty in graduate schools (business, education, law, medicine) who did not teach undergraduates during 2012.


## I-3. Undergraduate Class Size

In the table below, please use the following definitions to report information about the size of classes and class sections offered in the Fall 2012 term.

Class Sections: A class section is an organized course offered for credit, identified by discipline and number, meeting at a stated time or times in a classroom or similar setting, and not a subsection such as a laboratory or discussion session. Undergraduate class sections are defined as any sections in which at least one degree-seeking undergraduate student is enrolled for credit. Exclude distance learning classes and noncredit classes and individual instruction such as dissertation or thesis research, music instruction, or one-toone readings. Exclude students in independent study, co-operative programs, internships, foreign language taped tutor sessions, practicums, and all students in one-on-one classes. Each class section should be counted only once and should not be duplicated because of course catalog cross-listings.

Class Subsections: A class subsection includes any subsection of a course, such as laboratory, recitation, and discussion subsections that are supplementary in nature and are
scheduled to meet separately from the lecture portion of the course. Undergraduate subsections are defined as any subsections of courses in which degree-seeking undergraduate students enrolled for credit. As above, exclude noncredit classes and individual instruction such as dissertation or thesis research, music instruction, or one-toone readings. Each class subsection should be counted only once and should not be duplicated because of cross-listings.
