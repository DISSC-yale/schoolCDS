Provide 2017-2018 academic year costs of attendance for the following categories that are applicable to your institution.

X Check here if your institution's 2017-2018 academic year costs of attendance are not available at this time and provide an approximate date (i.e., month/day) when your institution's final 2017-2018 academic year costs of attendance will be available: February 2017
# G1. Undergraduate full-time tuition, required fees, room and board. 

List the typical tuition, required fees, and room and board for a full-time undergraduate student for the FULL 20162017 academic year ( 30 semester or 45 quarter hours for institutions that derive annual tuition by multiplying credit hour cost by number of credits). A full academic year refers to the period of time generally extending from September to June; usually equated to two semesters, two trimesters, three quarters, or the period covered by a four-one-four plan. Room and board is defined as double occupancy and 19 meals per week or the maximum meal plan. Required fees include only charges that all full-time students must pay that are not included in tuition (e.g., registration, health, or activity fees.) Do not include optional fees (e.g., parking, laboratory use).

# I. INSTRUCTIONAL FACULTY AND CLASS SIZE 

11. The following definition of full-time instructional faculty is used by the American Association of University Professors (AAUP) in its annual Faculty Compensation Survey (the part time definitions are not used by AAUP). Instructional Faculty is defined as those members of the instructional-research staff whose major regular assignment is instruction, including those with released time for research. Use the chart below to determine inclusions and exclusions:

|  | Full- <br> time | Part-time |
| :--: | :--: | :--: |
| a) Instructional faculty in preclinical and clinical medicine, faculty who are not paid (e.g., those who donate their services or are in the military), or researchonly faculty, post-doctoral fellows, or pre-doctoral fellows | Exclude | Include only if they teach one or more nonclinical credit courses |
| b) Administrative officers with titles such as dean of students, librarian, registrar, coach, and the like, even though they may devote part of their time to classroom instruction and may have faculty status | Exclude | Include if they teach one or more nonclinical credit courses |
| c) Other administrators/staff who teach one or more non-clinical credit courses even though they do not have faculty status | Exclude | Include |
| d) Undergraduate or graduate students who assist in the instruction of courses, but have titles such as teaching assistant, teaching fellow, and the like | Exclude | Exclude |
| e) Faculty on sabbatical or leave with pay | Include | Exclude |
| f) Faculty on leave without pay | Exclude | Exclude |
| g) Replacement faculty for faculty on sabbatical leave or leave with pay | Exclude | Include |

| i) Total number whose highest degree is unknown or other |  |  |  |
| j) Total number in stand-alone graduate/ professional programs in which faculty teach virtually only graduate-level students | 426 | 4 | 430 |

# Student to Faculty Ratio 

I2. Report the Fall 2016 ratio of full-time equivalent students (full-time plus $1 / 3$ part time) to full-time equivalent instructional faculty (full time plus $1 / 3$ part time). In the ratio calculations, exclude both faculty and students in stand-alone graduate or professional programs such as medicine, law, veterinary, dentistry, social work, business, or public health in which faculty teach virtually only graduate-level students. Do not count undergraduate or graduate student teaching assistants as faculty.

Fall 2016 Student to Faculty ratio: 4.25 to 1, based on 7032 students and 1654 faculty.

## I3. Undergraduate Class Size

In the table below, please use the following definitions to report information about the size of classes and class sections offered in the Fall 2016 term.

Class Sections: A class section is an organized course offered for credit, identified by discipline and number, meeting at a stated time or times in a classroom or similar setting, and not a subsection such as a laboratory or discussion session. Undergraduate class sections are defined as any sections in which at least one degree-seeking undergraduate student is enrolled for credit. Exclude distance learning classes and noncredit classes and individual instruction such as dissertation or thesis research, music instruction, or one-to-one readings. Exclude students in independent study, co-operative programs, internships, foreign language taped tutor sessions, practicums, and all students in one-on-one classes. Each class section should be counted only once and should not be duplicated because of course catalog cross-listings.

Class Subsections: A class subsection includes any subsection of a course, such as laboratory, recitation, and discussion subsections that are supplementary in nature and are scheduled to meet separately from the lecture portion of the course. Undergraduate subsections are defined as any subsections of courses in which degree-seeking undergraduate students enrolled for credit. As above, exclude noncredit classes and individual instruction such as dissertation or thesis research, music instruction, or one-to-one readings. Each class subsection should be counted only once and should not be duplicated because of cross-listings.

# J. DEGREES CONFERRED 

## J1. Degrees conferred between July 1, 2015 and June 30, 2016

For each of the following discipline areas, provide the percentage of diplomas/certificates, associate, and bacelor's degrees awarded. To determine the percentage, use majors, not headcount (e.g., students with one degree but a double major will be represented twice). Calculate the percentage from your institution's IPEDS Completions by using the sum of 1st and 2nd majors for each CIP code as the numerator and the sum of the Grand Total by 1st Majors and the Grand Total by 2nd major as the denominator. If you prefer, you can compute the percentages using 1st majors only.
