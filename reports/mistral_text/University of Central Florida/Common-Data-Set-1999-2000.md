## G1. Undergraduate full-time tuition, required fees, room and board

List the typical tuition, required fees, and room and board for a full-time undergraduate student for the FULL 2000-2001 academic year. A full academic year refers to the period of time generally extending from September to June; usually equated to two semesters or trimesters, three quarters, or the period covered by a four-one-four plan. Room and board is defined as double occupancy and 19 meals per week or the maximum meal plan. Required fees include only charges that all full-time students must pay that are not included in tuition (e.g., registration, health, or activity fees.) Do not include optional fees (e.g. parking, laboratory use).

# I. INSTRUCTIONAL FACULTY AND CLASS SIZE 

## I-1. Please report number of instructional faculty members in each category for Fall 1999.

The following definition of instructional faculty is used by the American Association of University Professors (AAUP) in its
annual Faculty Compensation Survey. Instructional Faculty is defined as those members of the instructionalresearch staff
whose major regular assignment is instruction, including those with released time for research. Institutions are asked to

EXCLUDE:
(a) instructional faculty in preclinical and clinical medicine
(b) administrative officers with titles such as dean of students, librarian, registrar, coach, and the like, even though they may devote part of their time to classroom instruction and may have faculty status,
(c) undergraduate or graduate students who assist in the instruction of courses, but have titles such as teaching assistant,
teaching fellow, and the like
(d) faculty on leave without pay, and
(e) replacement faculty for faculty on sabbatical leave.

Full-time: faculty employed on a full-time basis
Part-time: faculty teaching less than two semesters, three quarters, two trimesters, or two four-month sessions. Also includes adjuncts and part-time instructors.

Minority faculty: includes faculty who designate themselves as black, non-Hispanic; American Indian or Alaskan native;

Asian or Pacific Islander; or Hispanic.
Doctorate: includes Ph.D., Ed.D in education, DMA in musical arts, DBA in business administration, D. Eng or DES in
engineering.
First-professional: includes the fields of dentistry (DDS or DMD), medicine (MD), optometry (OD), osteopathic medicine (DO), pharmacy (DPharm or BPharm), podiatric medicine (DPM), veterinary medicine (DVM),
chiropractic (DC or DCM), law (JD) and theological professions (MDiv, MHL).
Terminal degree: the highest degree in a field: example, M. Arch (architecture) and MFA (master of fine arts).

|  | Full-time | Part-time | Total |
| :-- | --: | --: | --: |
| Total number of instructional faculty | 877 | 828 | 1705 |
| Total number who are members of minority groups | 178 | 90 | 268 |
| Total number who are women | 329 | 398 | 727 |
| Total number who are men | 548 | 430 | 978 |
| Total number who are non-resident aliens (international) | 27 | 60 | 87 |
| Total number with doctorate, first professional, or other <br> terminal degree | 702 |  |  |
| Total number whose highest degree is a master's but not a <br> terminal master's | 175 |  |  |
| Total number whose highest degree is a bachelor's | 0 |  |  |

# I-2. Student to Faculty Ratio 

Report the Fall 1999 ratio of full-time equivalent students (full-time plus $1 / 3$ part time) to full-time equivalent instructional faculty (full time plus $1 / 3$ part time). In the ratio calculations, exclude both faculty and students in stand-alone graduate or professional programs such as medicine, law, veterinary, dentistry, social work, business, or public health in which faculty
teach virtually only graduate level students. Do not count undergraduate or graduate student teaching assistants as faculty.

Fall 1999 Student to Faculty ratio:
20.6 to 1

## I-3. Undergraduate Class Size

In the table below, please use the following definitions to report information about the size of classes and class sections offered in the Fall 1999 term.

Class Sections: A class section is an organized course offered for credit, identified by discipline and number, meeting at a stated time or times in a classroom or similar setting, and not a subsection such as a laboratory or discussion session. Undergraduate class sections are defined as any sections in which at least one degree-seeking undergraduate student is
enrolled for credit. Exclude distance learning classes and noncredit classes and individual instruction such as dissertation or thesis research, music instruction, or one-to-one readings. Exclude students in independent study, co-operative programs, internships, foreign language taped tutor sessions, practicums, and all students in one-onone classes. Each class section
should be counted only once and should not be duplicated because of course catalog cross-listings.
Class Subsections: A class subsection includes any subsection of a course, such as laboratory, recitation, and discussion subsections that are supplementary in nature and are scheduled to meet separately from the lecture portion of the course. Undergraduate subsections are defined as any subsections of courses in which degreeseeking undergraduate students enrolled for credit. As above, exclude noncredit classes and individual instruction such as dissertation or thesis research, music instruction, or one-to-one readings. Each class subsection should be counted only once and should not be duplicated because of cross-listings.

Using the above definitions, please report for each of the following class-size intervals the number of class sections and class subsections offered in Fall 1999. For example, a lecture class with 800 students who met at another time in 40 separate labs with 20 students should be counted once in the " $100+$ " column in the class section
column and 40 times under the "20-29" column of the class subsections table.
