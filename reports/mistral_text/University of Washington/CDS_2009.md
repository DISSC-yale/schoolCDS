## I. Instructional Faculty and Class Size

Report the number of instructional faculty members in each category for Fall 2009. Include faculty who are on your institution's payroll on the census date your institution uses for IPEDS/AAUP.

CDS I1. The following definition of full-time instructional faculty is used by the American Association of University Professors (AAUP) in its annual Faculty Compensation Survey (the part time definitions are not used by AAUP). Instructional Faculty is defined as those members of the instructional-research staff whose major regular assignment is instruction, including those with released time for research. Use the chart below to determine inclusions and exclusions:

|  | Full-time | Part-time |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| (a) instructional faculty in preclinical and clinical medicine, faculty who are <br> not paid (e.g., those who donate their services or are in the military), or <br> research-only faculty, post-doctoral fellows, or pre-doctoral fellows | Exclude | Include only if they <br> teach one or more <br> non-clinical credit <br> courses |
| (b) administrative officers with titles such as dean of students, librarian, <br> registrar, coach, and the like, even though they may devote part of their <br> time to classroom instruction and may have faculty status | Exclude | Include if they teach <br> one or more non- <br> clinical credit courses |
| (c) other administrators/staff who teach one or more non-clinical credit <br> courses even though they do not have faculty status | Exclude | Include |
| (d) undergraduate or graduate students who assist in the instruction of <br> courses, but have titles such as teaching assistant, teaching fellow, and <br> the like | Exclude | Exclude |
| (e)faculty on sabbatical or leave with pay | Include | Exclude |
| (f) faculty on leave without pay | Exclude | Exclude |
| (g) replacement faculty for faculty on sabbatical leave or leave with pay | Exclude | Include |

Full-time instructional faculty: faculty employed on a full-time basis for instruction (including those with released time for research).
Part-time instructional faculty: Adjuncts and other instructors being paid solely for part-time classroom instruction. Also includes full-time faculty teaching less than two semesters, three quarters, two trimesters, or two four-month sessions. Employees who are not considered full-time instructional faculty but who teach one or more non-clinical credit courses may be counted as part-time faculty.
Minority faculty: includes faculty who designate themselves as black, non-Hispanic; American Indian or Alaska Native; Asian or Pacific Islander; or Hispanic.
Doctorate: includes such degrees as Doctor of Philosophy, Doctor of Education, Doctor of Juridical Science, and Doctor of Public Health in any field such as arts, sciences, education, engineering, business, and public administration. Also includes terminal degrees formerly designated as "first professional", including dentistry (DDS or DMD), medicine (MD), optometry (OD), osteopathic medicine (DO), pharmacy (DPharm or BPharm), podiatric medicine (DPM), veterinary medicine (DVM), chiropractic (DC or DCM), or law (JD).
Terminal master's degree: a master's degree that is considered the highest degree in a field: example, M. Arch (in architecture) and MFA (master of fine arts in art or theater), or theological professions (MDiv, MHL).
a. Total number of instructional faculty

| Full-Time | Part-Time |
| :-- | :-- |
| 3046 | 706 |
| 636 | 128 |
| 1139 | 354 |
| 1907 | 352 |

b. Total number who are members of minority groups

|  |  |
| :-- | :-- |
| c. Total number who are women | 1139 |

f. Total number with doctorate or other terminal degree

| Full-Time | Part-Time |
| :-- | :-- |
| 354 |  |
| 1907 | 352 |

(The next question is CDS I-3.)
# CDS I3. Undergraduate Class Size 

In the table below, please use the following definitions to report information about the size of classes and class sections offered in the Fall 2009 term.

Class Sections: A class section is an organized course offered for credit, identified by discipline and number, meeting at a stated time or times in a classroom or similar setting, and not a subsection such as a laboratory or discussion session. Undergraduate class sections are defined as any sections in which at least one degree-seeking undergraduate student is enrolled for credit. Exclude distance learning classes and noncredit classes and individual instruction such as dissertation or thesis research, music instruction, or one-to-one readings. Exclude students in independent study, cooperative programs, internships, foreign language taped tutor sessions, practicums, and all students in one-on-one classes. Each class section should be counted only once and should not be duplicated because of course catalog cross-listings.

Class Subsections: A class subsection includes any subsection of a course, such as laboratory, recitation, and discussion subsections that are supplementary in nature and are scheduled to meet separately from the lecture portion of the course. Undergraduate subsections are defined as any subsections of courses in which degree-seeking undergraduate students enrolled for credit. As above, exclude noncredit classes and individual instruction such as dissertation or thesis research, music instruction, or one-to-one readings. Each class subsection should be counted only once and should not be duplicated because of cross-listings.

Using the above definitions, please report for each of the following class-size intervals the number of class sections and class subsections offered in Fall 2009. For example, a lecture class with 800 students who met at another time in 40 separate labs with 20 students should be counted once in the "100+" column in the class section column and 40 times under the "20-29" column of the class subsections table.

Number of Class Sections with Undergraduates Enrolled.

## Undergraduate Class Size (provide numbers)

| Class | 2-9 | 10-19 | 20-29 | 30-39 | 40-49 | 50-99 | 100+ | Total |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Class <br> Sections | 261 | 508 | 651 | 251 | 239 | 238 | 182 | 2330 |
| Class <br> Sub- <br> sections | 231 | 452 | 1038 | 250 | 108 | 50 | 1 | 2130 |

## J. Degrees Offered and Awarded

## CDS J. Disciplinary areas of DEGREES CONFERRED

## Degrees conferred between July 1, 2008 and June 30, 2009

For each of the following discipline areas, provide the percentage of diplomas/certificates, associate, and bachelor's degrees awarded. To determine the percentage, use majors, not headcount (e.g., students with one degree but a double major will be represented twice). Calculate the percentage from your institution's IPEDS Completions by using the sum of 1st and 2nd majors for each CIP code as the numerator and the sum of the Grand Total by 1st majors and the Grand Total by 2nd major as the denominator. If you prefer, you can compute the percentages using 1st majors only.
Please note that the only certificate reported in the Degrees Conferred chart below is the certificate below the Associate degree. Any/all other certificates (i.e., Postbachelor's certificate, Post-master's certificate) should not be reported in this chart.

C=Certificate BELOW the Associate degree; A=Associate; B=Bachelor's
