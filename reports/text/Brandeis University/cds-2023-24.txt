B2. Enrollment by Racial/Ethnic Category.
Provide numbers of undergraduate students for each of the following categories as of the institution’s official fall
reporting date or as of October 15, 2023.
    ✓ Include international students only in the category "Nonresidents."
    ✓ Complete the “Total Undergraduates” column only if you cannot provide data for the first two columns.
    ✓ Report as your institution reports to IPEDS: persons who are Hispanic should be reported only on the
      Hispanic line, not under any race, and persons who are non-Hispanic multi-racial should be reported only
      under "Two or more races."
    ✓ New guidance from IPEDS for reporting aggregate data:
    Racial/ethnic designations are requested only for United States citizens, residents, and other eligible non-
    citizens.
    Eligible non-citizens include all students who completed high school or a GED equivalency within the United
    States (including DACA and undocumented students) and who were not on an F-1 non-immigrant student
    visa at the time of high school graduation.

    More information about other eligible (for financial aid purposes) non-citizens is available at
    https://studentaid.gov/understand-aid/eligibility/requirements/non-us-citizens.

    Nonresident – A person who is not a citizen or national of the United States and who is in this country on a
    student visa or temporary basis and does not have the right to remain indefinitely. Do not include DACA,
    undocumented, or other eligible noncitizens in this category.

    NOTE - Nonresidents are to be reported separately, in the boxes provided, rather than included in
    any of the seven racial/ethnic categories or in race/ethnicity unknown.

B4-B21: Graduation Rates
The items in this section correspond to data elements collected by the IPEDS Web-based Data Collection
System’s Graduation Rate Survey (GRS).

    ✓ For complete instructions and definitions of data elements, see the IPEDS GRS Forms and Instructions
      for the 2023-2024 Survey. https://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/use-the-data/survey-components/9/graduation-rates

In the following section for bachelor’s or equivalent programs, please disaggregate the Fall 2016 and Fall
2017 cohorts (formerly CDS B4-B11) into four groups:

    •     Students who received a Federal Pell Grant*
    •     Recipients of a subsidized Stafford Loan who did not receive a Pell Grant
    •     Students who did not receive either a Pell Grant or a subsidized Stafford Loan
    •     Total (all students, regardless of Pell Grant or subsidized loan status)
          *    Students who received both a Federal Pell Grant and a subsidized Stafford Loan should be reported in
               the "Recipients of a Federal Pell Grant" column.

For each graduation rate grid below, the numbers in the first three columns for Questions A-G should sum to the
cohort total in the fourth column (formerly CDS B4-B11).

                                       For Bachelor’s or Equivalent Programs
Please provide data for the Fall 2017 cohort if available. If Fall 2017 cohort data are not available, provide data
for the Fall 2016 cohort.

degree (or equivalent) by their second fall term is expected to be zero or very small. In exceptional cases
when a first-time student does satisfy all degree requirements including full credit completion (e.g., typically
120 credit hours) and is awarded a bachelor’s degree (or equivalent) by their second fall term, they are to be
considered “retained” for EF reporting purposes.

Please refer to the following financial aid definitions when completing Section H.

Awarded aid: The dollar amounts offered to financial aid applicants.

Financial aid applicant: Any applicant who submits any one of the institutionally required financial aid
applications/forms, such as the FAFSA.

Indebtedness: Aggregate dollar amount borrowed through any loan program (federal, state, subsidized,
unsubsidized, private, etc.; excluding parent loans) while the student was enrolled at an institution. Student loans
co-signed by a parent are assumed to be the responsibility of the student and should be included.

Institutional scholarships and grants: Endowed scholarships, annual gifts and tuition funded grants for which the
institution determines the recipient.

Financial need: As determined by your institution using the federal methodology and/or your institution's own
standards.

Need-based aid: College-funded or college-administered award from institutional, state, federal, or other sources
for which a student must have financial need to qualify. This includes both institutional and non-institutional student
aid (grants, jobs, and loans).

Need-based scholarship or grant aid: Scholarships and grants from institutional, state, federal, or other sources
for which a student must have financial need to qualify.

Need-based self-help aid: Loans and jobs from institutional, state, federal, or other sources for which a student
must demonstrate financial need to qualify.

Non-need-based scholarship or grant aid: Scholarships and grants, gifts, or merit-based aid from institutional,
state, federal, or other sources (including unrestricted funds or gifts and endowment income) awarded solely on the
basis of academic achievement, merit, or any other non-need-based reason. When reporting questions H1 and H2,
non-need-based aid that is used to meet need should be counted as need-based aid.

    Note: Suggested order of precedence for counting non-need money as need-based:

Non-need-based self-help aid: Loans and jobs from institutional, state, or other sources for which a student need
not demonstrate financial need to qualify.
Private student loans: A nonfederal loan made by a lender such as a bank, credit union or private lender used to
pay for up to the annual cost of education, less any financial aid received.


External scholarships and grants: Scholarships and grants received from outside (private) sources that students
bring with them (e.g., Kiwanis, National Merit scholarships). The institution may process paperwork to receive the
dollars, but it has no role in determining the recipient or the dollar amount awarded.

Work study and employment: Federal and state work study aid, and any employment packaged by your institution
in financial aid awards.

H1-H5: Aid Awarded to Enrolled Undergraduates
H1. Enter total dollar amounts awarded to enrolled full-time and less than full-time degree-seeking
    undergraduates (using the same cohort reported in CDS Question B1, “total degree-seeking”
    undergraduates) in the following categories.
    ✓ If the data being reported are final figures for the 2022-2023 academic year (see the next item below), use
      the 2022-2023 academic year's CDS Question B1 cohort.
    ✓ Include aid awarded to international students (i.e., those not qualifying for federal aid).
    ✓ Aid that is non-need-based but that was used to meet need should be reported in the need-based aid

In the table below, please use the following definitions to report information about the size of classes and class
sections offered in the Fall 2023 term.

    ✓ Please include classes that have been moved online in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Class Sections: A class section is an organized course offered for credit, identified by discipline and number,
meeting at a stated time or times in a classroom or similar setting, and not a subsection such as a laboratory or
discussion session. Undergraduate class sections are defined as any sections in which at least one degree-seeking
undergraduate student is enrolled for credit. Exclude distance learning classes and noncredit classes and individual
instruction such as dissertation or thesis research, music instruction, or one-to-one readings. Exclude students in
independent study, co-operative programs, internships, foreign language taped tutor sessions, practicums, and all
students in one-on-one classes. Each class section should be counted only once and should not be duplicated because
of course catalog cross-listings.

Class Subsections: A class subsection includes any subsection of a course, such as laboratory, recitation, and
discussion subsections that are supplementary in nature and are scheduled to meet separately from the lecture
portion of the course. Undergraduate subsections are defined as any subsections of courses in which degree-seeking
undergraduate students enrolled for credit. As above, exclude noncredit classes and individual instruction such as
dissertation or thesis research, music instruction, or one-to-one readings. Each class subsection should be counted
only once and should not be duplicated because of cross-listings.

Using the above definitions, please report for each of the following class-size intervals the number of class sections
and class subsections offered in Fall 2023. For example, a lecture class with 800 students who met at another time
in 40 separate labs with 20 students should be counted once in the “100+” column in the class section column and
40 times under the “20-29” column of the class subsections table.

                        J. Disciplinary areas of DEGREES CONFERRED
Degrees conferred between July 1, 2022 and June 30, 2023

For each of the following discipline areas, provide the percentage of diplomas/certificates, associate, and bachelor’s
degrees awarded. To determine the percentage, use majors, not headcount (e.g., students with one degree but a
double major will be represented twice). Calculate the percentage from your institution’s IPEDS Completions by
using the sum of 1st and 2nd majors for each CIP code as the numerator and the sum of the Grand Total by 1st Majors
and the Grand Total by 2nd major as the denominator. If you prefer, you can compute the percentages using 1st
majors only.
