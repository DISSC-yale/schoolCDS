Undergraduate full-time tuition, required fees, room and board List the typical tuition, required fees, and room
and board for a full-time undergraduate student for the FULL 2014-2015 academic year (30 semester or 45
quarter hours for institutions that derive annual tuition by multiplying credit hour cost by number of credits). A
full academic year refers to the period of time generally extending from September to June; usually equated to
two semesters, two trimesters, three quarters, or the period covered by a four-one-four plan. Room and board
is defined as double occupancy and 19 meals per week or the maximum meal plan. Required fees include only
charges that all full-time students must pay that are not included in tuition (e.g., registration, health, or activity
fees.) Do not include optional fees (e.g., parking, laboratory use).

Aid Awarded to Enrolled Undergraduates
Enter total dollar amounts awarded to enrolled full-time and less than full-time degree-seeking undergraduates
(using the same cohort reported in CDS Question B1, “total degree-seeking” undergraduates) in the following
categories. (Note: If the data being reported are final figures for the 2012-2013 academic year (see the next item
below), use the 2012-2013 academic year's CDS Question B1 cohort.) Include aid awarded to international students
(i.e., those not qualifying for federal aid). Aid that is non-need-based but that was used to meet need should be
reported in the need-based aid columns. (For a suggested order of precedence in assigning categories of aid to cover
need, see the entry for “non-need-based scholarship or grant aid” on the last page of the definitions section.)

Student to Faculty Ratio
Report the Fall 2013 ratio of full-time equivalent students (full-time plus 1/3 part time) to full-time equivalent
instructional faculty (full time plus 1/3 part time). In the ratio calculations, exclude both faculty and students in
stand-alone graduate or professional programs such as medicine, law, veterinary, dentistry, social work, business, or
public health in which faculty teach virtually only graduate-level students. Do not count undergraduate or graduate
student teaching assistants as faculty.

Fall 2013 Student to Faculty ratio                            8      to 1         (based on      7908     students

Undergraduate Class Size
In the table below, please use the following definitions to report information about the size of classes and class
sections offered in the Fall 2013 term.
Class Sections: A class section is an organized course offered for credit, identified by discipline and number,
meeting at a stated time or times in a classroom or similar setting, and not a subsection such as a laboratory or
discussion session. Undergraduate class sections are defined as any sections in which at least one degree-seeking
undergraduate student is enrolled for credit. Exclude distance learning classes and noncredit classes and individual
instruction such as dissertation or thesis research, music instruction, or one-to-one readings. Exclude students in
independent study, co-operative programs, internships, foreign language taped tutor sessions, practicums, and all
students in one-on-one classes. Each class section should be counted only once and should not be duplicated
because of course catalog cross-listings.

Class Subsections: A class subsection includes any subsection of a course, such as laboratory, recitation, and
discussion subsections that are supplementary in nature and are scheduled to meet separately from the lecture
portion of the course. Undergraduate subsections are defined as any subsections of courses in which degree-seeking
undergraduate students enrolled for credit. As above, exclude noncredit classes and individual instruction such as
dissertation or thesis research, music instruction, or one-to-one readings. Each class subsection should be counted
only once and should not be duplicated because of cross-listings.

Using the above definitions, please report for each of the following class-size intervals the number of class sections
and class subsections offered in Fall 2013. For example, a lecture class with 800 students who met at another time in
40 separate labs with 20 students should be counted once in the “100+” column in the class section column and 40
times under the “20-29” column of the class subsections table.

                          J. DEGREES CONFERRED

Degrees conferred between July 1, 2012 and June 30, 2013
For each of the following discipline areas, provide the percentage of diplomas/certificates, associate,
and bachelor’s degrees awarded. To determine the percentage, use majors, not headcount (e.g.,
students with one degree but a double major will be represented twice). Calculate the percentage from
your institution’s IPEDS Completions by using the sum of 1st and 2nd majors for each CIP code as the
numerator and the sum of the Grand Total by 1st Majors and the Grand Total by 2nd major as the
denominator. If you prefer, you can compute the percentages using 1st majors only.

who, through regular meetings, helps the student plan and implement immediate and long-term academic and
vocational goals.
Accelerated program: Completion of a college program of study in fewer than the usual number of years,
most often by attending summer sessions and carrying extra courses during the regular academic term.

Admitted student: Applicant who is offered admission to a degree-granting program at your institution.

                                          Financial Aid Definitions

Awarded aid: The dollar amounts offered to financial aid applicants.

External scholarships and grants: Scholarships and grants received from outside (private) sources that
students bring with them (e.g., Kiwanis, National Merit scholarships). The institution may process paperwork to

applications/forms, such as the FAFSA.
Indebtedness: Aggregate dollar amount borrowed through any loan program (federal, state, subsidized,
unsubsidized, private, etc.; excluding parent loans) while the student was enrolled at an institution. Student
loans co-signed by a parent are assumed to be the responsibility of the student and should be included.

Institutional scholarships and grants: Endowed scholarships, annual gifts and tuition funded grants for
which the institution determines the recipient.
Financial need: As determined by your institution using the federal methodology and/or your institution's own
standards.
Need-based aid: College-funded or college-administered award from institutional, state, federal, or other

institutional, state, federal, or other sources (including unrestricted funds or gifts and endowment income)
awarded solely on the basis of academic achievement, merit, or any other non-need-based reason. When
reporting questions H1 and H2, non-need-based aid that is used to meet need should be counted as need-
based aid.
Note: Suggested order of precedence for counting non-need money as need-based:
Non-need institutional grants
Non-need tuition waivers
Non-need athletic awards
Non-need federal grants
Non-need state grants
Non-need outside grants
Non-need student loans
Non-need parent loans
Non-need work
Non-need-based self-help aid: Loans and jobs from institutional, state, or other sources for which a student
