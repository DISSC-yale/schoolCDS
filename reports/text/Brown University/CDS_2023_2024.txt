B2   Enrollment by Racial/Ethnic Category
     Provide numbers of undergraduate students for each of the following categories as of the institution’s official fall reporting date or as
     of October 15, 2023.
     • Include international students only in the category "International."
     • Report as your institution reports to IPEDS: persons who are Hispanic should be reported only on the Hispanic line, not under any
     race, and persons who are non-Hispanic multi-racial should be reported only under "Two or more races."
     • New guidance from IPEDS for reporting aggregate data:
       Racial/ethnic designations are requested only for United States citizens, residents, and other eligible non-citizens. Eligible non-
       citizens include all students who completed high school or a GED equivalency within the United States (including DACA and
       undocumented students) and who were not on an F-1 non-immigrant student visa at the time of high school graduation.
       More information about other eligible (for financial aid purposes) non-citizens is available at
       https://studentaid.gov/understandaid/eligibility/requirements/non-us-citizens.
       International (Nonresident) - A person who is not a citizen or national of the United States and who is in this country on a student
       visa or temporary basis and does not have the right to remain indefinitely. Do not include DACA, undocumented, or other eligible
       noncitizens in this category.

      Graduation Rates
      The items in this section correspond to data elements collected by the IPEDS Web-based Data Collection System’s Graduation Rate
      Survey (GRS). For complete instructions and definitions of data elements, see the IPEDS GRS Forms and Instructions for the 2023-
      24 Survey.
B4    For Bachelor's or Equivalent Institutions
      In the following section for bachelor’s or equivalent programs, please disaggregate the Fall 2016 and Fall 2017 cohorts (formerly
      CDS B4-B11) into four groups:
      • Students who received a Federal Pell Grant*
      • Recipients of a subsidized Stafford Loan who did not receive a Pell Grant
      • Students who did not receive either a Pell Grant or a subsidized Stafford Loan
      • Total (all students, regardless of Pell Grant or subsidized loan status)
        *Students who received both a Federal Pell Grant and a subsidized Stafford Loan should be reported in the "Recipients of a
        Federal Pell Grant" column.
        For each graduation rate grid below, the numbers in the first three columns for Questions A-G should sum to the cohort total in the
        fourth column (formerly CDS B4-B11).

       test scores.
       • Include information for ALL enrolled, degree-seeking, first-time, first-year students who submitted test scores.
       • Do not include partial test scores (e.g., mathematics scores but not critical reading for a category of students) or combine other
       standardized test results (such as TOEFL) in this item.
       • Do not convert SAT scores to ACT scores and vice versa.
       • If a student submitted multiple sets of scores for a single test, report this information according to how you use the data.
       For example:
          If you consider the highest scores from either submission, use the highest combination of scores (e.g., verbal from one submission,
          math from the other).
          If you average the scores, use the average to report the scores.

D22 Describe other military/veteran transfer credit policies unique to your institution: Brown does not have separate
      transfer credit guidelines for military veterans. The maximum number of course credits any student may receive via
      transfer is 15.0 course credits. Each 1.0 Brown course credit is equivalent to 4 semester credits or 6 quarter units.
      Brown awards transfer credit to incoming transfer students per our pre-Brown transfer credit guidelines (see
      https://www.brown.edu/academics/college/advising/transfer-students). Defense Language Institute courses may be
      transferred subject to these guidelines. CLEP or DSST test results do not earn transfer credit but may be used by
      students (like AP scores and SAT Subject Test results) for placement purposes pending academic department
      evaluation and recommendation.

     List the typical tuition, required fees, and food and housing for a full-time undergraduate student for the FULL 2024-2025 academic
     year. (30 semester hours or 45 quarter hours for institutions that derive annual tuition by multiplying credit hour cost by number of
     credits).
       • A full academic year refers to the period of time generally extending from September to June; usually equated to two semesters,
       two trimesters, three quarters, or the period covered by a four-one-four plan.
       • Food and housing is defined as double occupancy and 19 meals per week or the maximum meal plan.
       • Required fees include only charges that all full-time students must pay that are not included in tuition (e.g., registration, health, or
       activity fees).
       • Do not include optional fees (e.g., parking, laboratory use).

I3 Undergraduate Class Size
   In the table below, please use the following definitions to report information about the size of classes and class sections offered in the Fall
   2023 term.

   Class Sections: A class section is an organized course offered for credit, identified by discipline and number, meeting at a stated time or
   times in a classroom or similar setting, and not a subsection such as a laboratory or discussion session. Undergraduate class sections
   are defined as any sections in which at least one degree-seeking undergraduate student is enrolled for credit. Exclude distance learning
   classes and noncredit classes and individual instruction such as dissertation or thesis research, music instruction, or one-to-one readings.
   Exclude students in independent study, co-operative programs, internships, foreign language taped tutor sessions, practicums, and all
   students in one-on-one classes. Each class section should be counted only once and should not be duplicated because of course catalog
   cross-listings.

   Class Subsections: A class subsection includes any subsection of a course, such as laboratory, recitation, and discussion subsections
   that are supplementary in nature and are scheduled to meet separately from the lecture portion of the course. Undergraduate subsections
   are defined as any subsections of courses in which degree-seeking undergraduate students enrolled for credit. As above, exclude
   noncredit classes and individual instruction such as dissertation or thesis research, music instruction, or one-to-one readings. Each class
   subsection should be counted only once and should not be duplicated because of cross-listings.


   Using the above definitions, please report for each of the following class-size intervals the number of class sections and class
   subsections offered in Fall 2023. For example, a lecture class with 800 students who met at another time in 40 separate labs with 20
   students should be counted once in the “100+” column in the class section column and 40 times under the “20-29” column of the class
   subsections table.

J1 Degrees conferred between July 1, 2022 and June 30, 2023
   For each of the following discipline areas, provide the percentage of diplomas/certificates, associate, and bachelor’s degrees awarded.
   To determine the percentage, use majors, not headcount (e.g., students with one degree but a double major will be represented twice).
   Calculate the percentage from your institution’s IPEDS Completions by using the sum of 1st and 2nd majors for each CIP code as the
   numerator and the sum of the Grand Total by 1st Majors and the Grand Total by 2nd major as the denominator. If you prefer, you can
   compute the percentages using 1st majors only.

FAFSA.

the recipient.
Financial need: As determined by your institution using the federal methodology and/or your institution's own standards.
