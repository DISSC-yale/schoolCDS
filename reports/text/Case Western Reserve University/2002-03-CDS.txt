   are not included in tuition (e.g., registration, health, or activity fees.) Do not include optional fees (e.g.,
   parking, laboratory use).

     Enter total dollar amounts awarded to full-time and less than full-time degree-seeking undergraduates
     (using the same cohort reported in CDS Question B1, “total degree-seeking” undergraduates)

     federal aid). Aid that is non-need-based but that was used to meet need should be reported in
     the need-based aid columns. (For a suggested order of precedence in assigning categories of aid to
     cover need, see the entry for “non-need-based gift aid” on the last page of the definitions section.)

                           I. Instructional Faculty and Class Size
I1   Please report number of instructional faculty members in each category for Fall 2002.
     The following definition of instructional faculty is used by the American Association of University Professors
     (AAUP) in its annual Faculty Compensation Survey. Instructional Faculty is defined as those members of the
     instructional-research staff whose major regular assignment is instruction, including those with released
     time for research. Institutions are asked to EXCLUDE:
     (a) instructional faculty in preclinical and clinical medicine
     (b) administrative officers with titles such as dean of students, librarian, registrar, coach, and the like, even
     though they may devote part of their time to classroom instruction and may have faculty status,
     (c) undergraduate or graduate students who assist in the instruction of courses, but have titles such as
     teaching assistant, teaching fellow, and the like
     (d) faculty on leave without pay, and
     (e) replacement faculty for faculty on sabbatical leave.

     Full-time: faculty employed on a full-time basis
     Part-time: faculty teaching less than two semesters, three quarters, two trimesters, or two four-month
     sessions. Also includes adjuncts and part-time instructors.
     Minority faculty: includes faculty who designate themselves as black, non-Hispanic; American Indian or
     Alaskan native; Asian or Pacific Islander; or Hispanic.
     Doctorate: includes such degrees as Doctor of Education, Doctor of Juridical Science, Doctor of Public
     Health, and Doctor of Philosophy degree in any field such as agronomy, food technology, education,
     engineering, public administration, ophthalmology, or radiology.
     First-professional: includes the fields of dentistry (DDS or DMD), medicine (MD), optometry (OD),
     osteopathic medicine (DO), pharmacy (DPharm or BPharm), podiatric medicine (DPM), veterinary medicine
     (DVM), chiropractic (DC or DCM), law (JD) and theological professions (MDiv, MHL).
     Terminal degree: the highest degree in a field: example, M. Arch (architecture) and MFA (master of fine
     arts).


                                                                                     Full-Time   Part-Time      Total

I2   Student to Faculty Ratio
     Report the Fall 2002 ratio of full-time equivalent students (full-time plus 1/3 part time) to full-time
     equivalent instructional faculty (full time plus 1/3 part time). In the ratio calculations, exclude both faculty
     and students in stand-alone graduate or professional programs such as medicine, law, veterinary, dentistry,
     social work, business, or public health in which faculty teach virtually only graduate level students. Do not
     count undergraduate or graduate student teaching assistants as faculty.

     Fall 2002 Student to Faculty ratio                           8       to 1.

I3   Undergraduate Class Size
     In the table below, please use the following definitions to report information about the size of classes and
     class sections offered in the Fall 2002 term.

     Class Sections: A class section is an organized course offered for credit, identified by discipline and
     number, meeting at a stated time or times in a classroom or similar setting, and not a subsection such as a
     laboratory or discussion session. Undergraduate class sections are defined as any sections in which at least
     one degree-seeking undergraduate student is enrolled for credit. Exclude distance learning classes and
     noncredit classes and individual instruction such as dissertation or thesis research, music instruction, or one-
     to-one readings. Exclude students in independent study, co-operative programs, internships, foreign
     language taped tutor sessions, practicums, and all students in one-on-one classes. Each class section
     should be counted only once and should not be duplicated because of course catalog cross-listings.

     Class Subsections: A class subsection includes any subsection of a course, such as laboratory,
     recitation, and discussion subsections that are supplementary in nature and are scheduled to meet
     separately from the lecture portion of the course. Undergraduate subsections are defined as any
     subsections of courses in which degree-seeking undergraduate students enrolled for credit. As above,
     exclude noncredit classes and individual instruction such as dissertation or thesis research, music
     instruction, or one-to-one readings. Each class subsection should be counted only once and should not be
     duplicated because of cross-listings.

     Using the above definitions, please report for each of the following class-size intervals the number of class
     sections and class subsections offered in Fall 2001. For example, a lecture class with 800 students who met
     at another time in 40 separate labs with 20 students should be counted once in the “100+” column in the
     class section column and 40 times under the “20-29” column of the class subsections table.
