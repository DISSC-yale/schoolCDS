                                         G. Annual Expenses
     Provide 2005-2006 academic year costs for the following categories that are applicable to your
     institution.


G1 Undergraduate full-time tuition, required fees, room and board List the typical tuition, required fees,
   and room and board for a full-time undergraduate student for the FULL 2005-2006 academic year (30
   semester or 45 quarter hours for institutions that derive annual tuition by multiplying credit hour cost by
   number of credits). A full academic year refers to the period of time generally extending from September
   to June; usually equated to two semesters, two trimesters, three quarters, or the period covered by a four-
   one-four plan. Room and board is defined as double occupancy and 19 meals per week or the maximum
   meal plan. Required fees include only charges that all full-time students must pay that are not included in
   tuition (e.g., registration, health, or activity fees.) Do not include optional fees (e.g., parking, laboratory
   use).

     Aid Awarded to Enrolled Undergraduates

     Enter total dollar amounts awarded to full-time and less than full-time degree-seeking undergraduates
     (using the same cohort reported in CDS Question B1, “total degree-seeking” undergraduates) in the
     following categories. Include aid awarded to international students (i.e., those not qualifying for federal aid).
     Aid that is non-need-based but that was used to meet need should be reported in the need-based

     entry for “non-need-based scholarship or grant aid” on the last page of the definitions section.)

I3   Undergraduate Class Size
     In the table below, please use the following definitions to report information about the size of classes and
     class sections offered in the Fall 2004 term.

     Class Sections: A class section is an organized course offered for credit, identified by discipline and
     number, meeting at a stated time or times in a classroom or similar setting, and not a subsection such as a
     laboratory or discussion session. Undergraduate class sections are defined as any sections in which at
     least one degree-seeking undergraduate student is enrolled for credit. Exclude distance learning classes
     and noncredit classes and individual instruction such as dissertation or thesis research, music instruction,
     or one-to-one readings. Exclude students in independent study, co-operative programs, internships, foreign
     language taped tutor sessions, practicums, and all students in one-on-one classes. Each class section
     should be counted only once and should not be duplicated because of course catalog cross-listings.

     Class Subsections: A class subsection includes any subsection of a course, such as laboratory,
     recitation, and discussion subsections that are supplementary in nature and are scheduled to meet
     separately from the lecture portion of the course. Undergraduate subsections are defined as any
     subsections of courses in which degree-seeking undergraduate students enrolled for credit. As above,
     exclude noncredit classes and individual instruction such as dissertation or thesis research, music
     instruction, or one-to-one readings. Each class subsection should be counted only once and should not be
     duplicated because of cross-listings.

     Using the above definitions, please report for each of the following class-size intervals the number of class
     sections and class subsections offered in Fall 2004. For example, a lecture class with 800 students who
     met at another time in 40 separate labs with 20 students should be counted once in the “100+” column in
     the class section column and 40 times under the “20-29” column of the class subsections table.

J1   Degrees conferred between July 1, 2003 and June 30, 2004
     For each of the following discipline areas, provide the percentage of diplomas/certificates, associate, and
     bachelor degrees awarded. To determine the percentage, use majors, not headcount (e.g., students with
     one degree but a double major will be represented twice). Calculate the percentage from your institution's
     IPEDS Completions by using the sum of first and second majors for each CIP code as the numerator and
     the sum of the Grand Total by First Major and the Grand Total by Second Major as the denominator. (If you
     prefer, you can compute the percentages using first majors only.)
