B2. Enrollment by Racial/Ethnic Category
Provide numbers of undergraduate students for each of the following categories as of the institution’s official fall reporting date or as of October 15, 2023.



1. Include international students only in the category "Nonresidents."

2. Complete the “Total Undergraduates” column only if you cannot provide data for the first two columns.

3. Report as your institution reports to IPEDS: persons who are Hispanic should be reported only on the Hispanic line, not under any race, and persons who are non-
Hispanic multi-racial should be reported only under "Two or more races."

4. New guidance from IPEDS for reporting aggregate data: "Racial/ethnic designations are requested only for United States citizens, residents, and other eligible non-
citizens. Eligible non-citizens include all students who completed high school or a GED equivalency within the United States (including DACA and undocumented students)
and who were not on an F-1 non-immigrant student visa at the time of high school graduation."

5. More information about other eligible (for financial aid purposes) non-citizens is available at https://studentaid.gov/understandaid/eligibility/requirements/non-us-
citizens.


6. Nonresident – A person who is not a citizen or national of the United States and who is in this country on a student visa or temporary basis and does not have the
right to remain indefinitely. Do not include DACA, undocumented, or other eligible noncitizens in this category. Nonresidents are to be reported separately, in the boxes
provided, rather than included in any of the seven racial/ethnic categories or in race/ethnicity unknown.

For the cohort of all full-time bachelor’s (or equivalent) degree-seeking undergraduate students who entered your institution as first-year students in Fall
2022 (or the preceding summer term), what percentage was enrolled at your institution as of the date your institution calculates its official enrollment in Fall
2023.

Total students retained = students from the Fall 2022 cohort who are still enrolled as of Fall 2023 + students from
Fall 2022 cohort who completed their bachelor’s program as of Fall 2023

(Students from the Fall 2022 cohort still enrolled as of Fall 2023 + Students from Fall 2022 cohort who completed their
bachelor’s program as of Fall 2023)/(Adjusted Fall 2022 cohort) *100

Note: The number of first-time students seeking a bachelor’s degree (or equivalent) who attain a bachelor’s degree (or
equivalent) by their second fall term is expected to be zero or very small. In exceptional cases when a first-time student does satisfy all degree requirements
including full credit completion (e.g., typically 120 credit hours) and is awarded a bachelor’s degree (or equivalent) by their second fall term, they are to be
considered “retained” for EF reporting purposes.

                                      Enter retention rate:         92%

C1. Applications: First-time, First-year Students
Provide the number of degree-seeking, first-time, first-year students who applied, were admitted, and enrolled (full- or part-time) in Fall 2023.

- Include early decision, early action, and students who began studies during summer in this cohort.

- Applicants should include only those students who fulfilled the requirements for consideration for admission (i.e., who completed actionable
applications) and who have been notified of one of the following actions: admission, non-admission, placement on waiting list, or application withdrawn
(by applicant or institution).

- Admitted applicants should include wait-listed students who were subsequently offered admission.

- Since the total may include students who did not provide gender data, the detail need not sum to the total.

- If your institution collects and reports non-binary gender data, please use the “Another Gender” category.

- Note that recent high school graduates and other students without prior postsecondary experience will still be considered “first-time students” for fall
enrollment reporting purposes even if they enrolled in the summer prior to fall enrollment.

C9. First-time, first-year profile: National standardized test scores (SAT/ACT)
Provide information for all enrolled, degree-seeking, full-time and part-time, first-time, first-year students enrolled in Fall 2023, including students
who began studies during summer, international students/nonresidents, and students admitted under special arrangements. Report the percent and
number of first-time, first-year students enrolled in Fall 2023 who submitted national standardized (SAT/ACT) test scores.


       1. Include information for ALL enrolled, degree-seeking, first-time, first-year students who submitted test scores.
       2. Do not include partial test scores (e.g., mathematics scores but not critical reading for a category of students) or combine other standardized
       3. Do not convert SAT scores to ACT scores and vice versa.
       4. If a student submitted multiple sets of scores for a single test, report this information according to how you use the data.
       For example: If you consider the highest scores from either submission, use the highest combination of scores (e.g., verbal from one submission,
       math from the other). If you average the scores, use the average to report the scores.


                                                                                  Percent          Number

Please refer to the following financial aid definitions when completing Section H.

Awarded aid: The dollar amounts offered to financial aid applicants.

Financial aid applicant: Any applicant who submits any one of the institutionally required financial aid applications/forms, such as the FAFSA.

Indebtedness: Aggregate dollar amount borrowed through any loan program (federal, state, subsidized, unsubsidized, private, etc.; excluding parent
loans) while the student was enrolled at an institution. Student loans co-signed by a parent are assumed to be the responsibility of the student and
should be included.

Institutional scholarships and grants: Endowed scholarships, annual gifts and tuition funded grants for which the institution determines the recipient.

Financial need: As determined by your institution using the federal methodology and/or your institution's own standards.

Need-based aid: College-funded or college-administered award from institutional, state, federal, or other sources for which a student must have
financial need to qualify. This includes both institutional and non-institutional student aid (grants, jobs, and loans).

Need-based scholarship or grant aid: Scholarships and grants from institutional, state, federal, or other sources for which a student must have financial
need to qualify.

Need-based self-help aid: Loans and jobs from institutional, state, federal, or other sources for which a student must demonstrate financial need to
qualify.

Non-need-based scholarship or grant aid: Scholarships and grants, gifts, or merit-based aid from institutional, state, federal, or other sources (including
unrestricted funds or gifts and endowment income) awarded solely on the basis of academic achievement, merit, or any other non-need-based reason.
When reporting questions H1 and H2, non-need-based aid that is used to meet need should be counted as need-based aid.

Note: Suggested order of precedence for counting non-need money as need-based:

1.Non-need ins tu onal grants           6. Non-need outside grants
2.Non-need tui on waivers               7. Non-need student loans
3.Non-need athle c awards               8. Non-need parent loans
4.Non-need federal grants               9. Non-need work
5.Non-need state grants

Non-need-based self-help aid: Loans and jobs from institutional, state, or other sources for which a student need not demonstrate financial need to
qualify.

Private student loans: A nonfederal loan made by a lender such as a bank, credit union or private lender used to pay for up to the annual cost of
education, less any financial aid received.

External scholarships and grants: Scholarships and grants received from outside (private) sources that students bring with them (e.g., Kiwanis, National
Merit scholarships). The institution may process paperwork to receive the dollars, but it has no role in determining the recipient or the dollar amount
awarded.

Work study and employment: Federal and state work study aid, and any employment packaged by your institution in financial aid awards.

H1. Aid Awarded to Enrolled Undergraduates
Enter total dollar amounts awarded to enrolled full-time and less than full-time degree-seeking undergraduates (using the same cohort reported in CDS
Question B1, “total degree-seeking” undergraduates) in the following categories.
         ✔ If the data being reported are final figures for the 2022-2023 academic year, use the 2022-2023 academic year's CDS Question B1 Cohort.

         ✔ Include aid awarded to international students (i.e., those not qualifying for federal aid).
         ✔ Aid that is non-need-based but that was used to meet need should be reported in the need-based aid column.
         ✔ For a suggested order of precedence in assigning categories of aid to cover need, see the entry for “non-need-based
         scholarship or grant aid” on the last page of the definitions section.

                                Do NOT include any aid related to the CARES Act or unique to the COVID-19 pandemic.

         The "average per-undergraduate-borrower cumulative principal borrowed" is designed to provide better information about student borrowing
         from federal and nonfederal (institutional, state, commercial) sources.

         The numbers, percentages, and averages for each row should be based only on the loan source specific for the particular row. For example, the
         federal loans average (Row B) should only be the cumulative average of federal loans and the private loans average (Row E) should only the

I3. Undergraduate Class Size
In the table below, please report information about the size of classes and class sections offered in the Fall 2023 term.

Class Sections: A class section is an organized course offered for credit, identified by discipline and number, meeting at a stated time or times
in a classroom or similar setting, and not a subsection such as a laboratory or discussion session. Undergraduate class sections are defined as
any sections in which at least one degree-seeking undergraduate student is enrolled for credit. Exclude distance learning classes and
noncredit classes and individual instruction such as dissertation or thesis research, music instruction, or one-to-one readings. Exclude students
in independent study, co-operative programs, internships, foreign language taped tutor sessions, practicums, and all students in one-on-one
classes. Each class section should be counted only once and should not be duplicated because of course catalog cross-listings.

Class Subsections: A class subsection includes any subsection of a course, such as laboratory, recitation, and discussion subsections that are
supplementary in nature and are scheduled to meet separately from the lecture portion of the course. Undergraduate subsections are defined
as any subsections of courses in which degree-seeking undergraduate students enrolled for credit. As above, exclude noncredit classes and
individual instruction such as dissertation or thesis research, music instruction, or one-to-one readings. Each class subsection should be
counted only once and should not be duplicated because of cross-listings.



Using the above definitions, please report for each of the following class-size intervals the number of class sections and class subsections
offered in Fall 2023. For example, a lecture class with 800 students who met at another time in 40 separate labs with 20 students should be
counted once in the “100+” column in the class section column and 40 times under the “20-29” column of the class subsections table.

                                          J. DISCIPLINARY AREAS of DEGREES CONFERRED

Degrees conferred between July 1, 2022 and June 30, 2023.

For each of the following discipline areas, provide the percentage of diplomas/certificates, associate, and bachelor’s degrees awarded. To
determine the percentage, use majors, not headcount (e.g., students with one degree but a double major will be represented twice).
                                                                                           st      nd
Calculate the percentage from your institution’s IPEDS Completions by using the sum of 1 and 2 majors for each CIP code as the
numerator and the sum of the Grand Total by 1st Majors and the Grand Total by 2nd major as the denominator. If you prefer, you can
compute the percentages using 1st majors only.
