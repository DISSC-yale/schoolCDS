Graduation Rates
The items in this section correspond to data elements collected by the IPEDS Web-based Data Collection System’s Graduation Rate
Survey (GRS). For complete instructions and definitions of data elements, see the IPEDS GRS Forms and Instructions for the 2018-19
Survey.

For Bachelor's or Equivalent Programs

Please provide data for the Fall 2012 cohort if available. If Fall 2012 cohort data are
not available, provide data for the Fall 2011 cohort.
In the following section for bachelor’s or equivalent programs, please disaggregate the Fall 2010 and Fall 2011 cohorts (formerly CDS
B4-B11) into four groups:
• Students who received a Federal Pell Grant*
• Recipients of a subsidized Stafford Loan who did not receive a Pell Grant
• Students who did not receive either a Pell Grant or a subsidized Stafford Loan
• Total (all students, regardless of Pell Grant or subsidized loan status)
*Students who received both a Federal Pell Grant and a subsidized Stafford Loan should be reported in the "Recipients of a Federal
Pell Grant" column.
For each graduation rate grid below, the numbers in the first three columns for Questions A-G should sum to the cohort total in the
fourth column (formerly CDS B4-B11).

Fall 2012 Cohort

Report for the cohort of full-time first-time bachelor's (or equivalent) degree-seeking undergraduate students who entered
in Fall 2012. Include in the cohort those who entered your institution during the summer term preceding Fall 2012.

G1 Undergraduate full-time tuition, required fees, room and board List the typical tuition, required fees, and
   room and board for a full-time undergraduate student for the FULL 2019-2020 academic year (30 semester
   or 45 quarter hours for institutions that derive annual tuition by multiplying credit hour cost by number of
   credits). A full academic year refers to the period of time generally extending from September to June;
   usually equated to two semesters, two trimesters, three quarters, or the period covered by a four-one-four
   plan. Room and board is defined as double occupancy and 19 meals per week or the maximum meal plan.
   Required fees include only charges that all full-time students must pay that are not included in tuition (e.g.,
   registration, health, or activity fees.) Do not include optional fees (e.g., parking, laboratory use).

     Class Subsections: A class subsection includes any subsection of a course, such as laboratory,
     recitation, and discussion subsections that are supplementary in nature and are scheduled to meet
     separately from the lecture portion of the course. Undergraduate subsections are defined as any
     subsections of courses in which degree-seeking undergraduate students enrolled for credit. As above,
     exclude noncredit classes and individual instruction such as dissertation or thesis research, music
     instruction, or one-to-one readings. Each class subsection should be counted only once and should not be
     duplicated because of cross-listings.


     Using the above definitions, please report for each of the following class-size intervals the number of class
     sections and class subsections offered in Fall 2018. For example, a lecture class with 800 students who

J1 Degrees conferred between July 1, 2017 and June 30, 2018
   For each of the following discipline areas, provide the percentage of diplomas/certificates, associate, and bachelor’s degrees
   awarded. To determine the percentage, use majors, not headcount (e.g., students with one degree but a double major will be
   represented twice). Calculate the percentage from your institution’s IPEDS Completions by using the sum of 1st and 2nd majors
   for each CIP code as the numerator and the sum of the Grand Total by 1st Majors and the Grand Total by 2nd major as the
   denominator. If you prefer, you can compute the percentages using 1st majors only.
