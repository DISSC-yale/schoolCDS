    B4-B21: Graduation Rates
    The items in this section correspond to data elements collected by the IPEDS Web-based Data Collection
    System’s Graduation Rate Survey (GRS).

    •   For complete instructions and definitions of data elements, see the IPEDS GRS Forms and Instructions
        for the 2020-2021 Survey. https://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/use-the-data/survey-components/9/graduation-rates

    In the following section for bachelor’s or equivalent programs, please disaggregate the Fall 2013 and
    Fall 2014 cohorts (formerly CDS B4-B11) into four groups:
    • Students who received a Federal Pell Grant*
    • Recipients of a subsidized Stafford Loan who did not receive a Pell Grant
    • Students who did not receive either a Pell Grant or a subsidized Stafford Loan
    • Total (all students, regardless of Pell Grant or subsidized loan status)

    *Students who received both a Federal Pell Grant and a subsidized Stafford Loan should be reported in the
    "Recipients of a Federal Pell Grant" column.

    For each graduation rate grid below, the numbers in the first three columns for Questions A-G should sum to
    the cohort total in the fourth column (formerly CDS B4-B11).

                                               For Bachelor’s or Equivalent Programs

    Please provide data for the Fall 2014 cohort if available. If Fall 2014 cohort data are not available, provide
    data for the Fall 2013 cohort.

     international students/nonresident aliens, and students admitted under special arrangements.

C9   Percent and number of first-time, first-year (freshman) students enrolled in Fall 2020 who submitted
     national standardized (SAT/ACT) test scores.
     •    Include information for ALL enrolled, degree-seeking, first-time, first-year (freshman) students
          who submitted test scores.
     •    Do not include partial test scores (e.g., mathematics scores but not critical reading for a category of
          students) or combine other standardized test results (such as TOEFL) in this item.
     •    Do not convert SAT scores to ACT scores and vice versa.
     •    If a student submitted multiple sets of scores for a single test, report this information according to how
          you use the data. For example:
           •   If you consider the highest scores from either submission, use the highest combination of scores
               (e.g., verbal from one submission, math from the other).
           •   If you average the scores, use the average to report the scores.

                                      H. FINANCIAL AID
     Please refer to the following financial aid definitions when completing Section H.
     Awarded aid: The dollar amounts offered to financial aid applicants.

     Financial aid applicant: Any applicant who submits any one of the institutionally required
     financial aid applications/forms, such as the FAFSA.
     Indebtedness: Aggregate dollar amount borrowed through any loan program (federal, state,
     subsidized, unsubsidized, private, etc.; excluding parent loans) while the student was enrolled at
     an institution. Student loans co-signed by a parent are assumed to be the responsibility of the
     student and should be included
     Institutional scholarships and grants: Endowed scholarships, annual gifts and tuition funded
     grants for which the institution determines the recipient.
     Financial need: As determined by your institution using the federal methodology and/or your
     institution's own standards.
     Need-based aid: College-funded or college-administered award from institutional, state, federal,
     or other sources for which a student must have financial need to qualify. This includes both
     institutional and non-institutional student aid (grants, jobs, and loans).
     Need-based scholarship or grant aid: Scholarships and grants from institutional, state, federal,
     or other sources for which a student must have financial need to qualify.
     Need-based self-help aid: Loans and jobs from institutional, state, federal, or other sources for
     which a student must demonstrate financial need to qualify.
     Non-need-based scholarship or grant aid: Scholarships and grants, gifts, or merit-based aid
     from institutional, state, federal, or other sources (including unrestricted funds or gifts and
     endowment income) awarded solely on the basis of academic achievement, merit, or any other
     non-need-based reason. When reporting questions H1 and H2, non-need-based aid that is used
     to meet need should be counted as need-based aid.
            Note: Suggested order of precedence for counting non-need money as need-based:
             1. Non-need institutional grants 6. Non-need outside grants
             2. Non-need tuition waivers      7. Non-need student loans
             3. Non-need athletic awards      8. Non-need parent loans
             4. Non-need federal grants       9. Non-need work
             5. Non-need state grants
     Non-need-based self-help aid: Loans and jobs from institutional, state, or other sources for
     which a student need not demonstrate financial need to qualify.
     Private student loans: A nonfederal loan made by a lender such as a bank, credit union or
     private lender used to pay for up to the annual cost of education, less any financial aid received.
     External scholarships and grants: Scholarships and grants received from outside (private)
     sources that students bring with them (e.g., Kiwanis, National Merit scholarships). The institution
     may process paperwork to receive the dollars, but it has no role in determining the recipient or
     Work study and employment: Federal and state work study aid, and any employment
     packaged by your institution in financial aid awards.

     DO NOT INCLUDE ANY AID RELATED TO THE CARES ACT OR UNIQUE THE COVID-19

I-3. Undergraduate Class Size
     In the table below, please use the following definitions to report information about the size of classes and
     class sections offered in the Fall 2020 term.
     • Please include classes that have been moved online in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

     Class Sections: A class section is an organized course offered for credit, identified by discipline and
     number, meeting at a stated time or times in a classroom or similar setting, and not a subsection such as a
     laboratory or discussion session. Undergraduate class sections are defined as any sections in which at
     least one degree-seeking undergraduate student is enrolled for credit. Exclude distance learning classes
     and noncredit classes and individual instruction such as dissertation or thesis research, music instruction,
     or one-to-one readings. Exclude students in independent study, co-operative programs, internships, foreign
     language taped tutor sessions, practicums, and all students in one-on-one classes. Each class section
     should be counted only once and should not be duplicated because of course catalog cross-listings.

     Class Subsections: A class subsection includes any subsection of a course, such as laboratory,
     recitation, and discussion subsections that are supplementary in nature and are scheduled to meet
     separately from the lecture portion of the course. Undergraduate subsections are defined as any
     subsections of courses in which degree-seeking undergraduate students enrolled for credit. As above,
     exclude noncredit classes and individual instruction such as dissertation or thesis research, music
     instruction, or one-to-one readings. Each class subsection should be counted only once and should not be
     duplicated because of cross-listings.
     Using the above definitions, please report for each of the following class-size intervals the number of class
     sections and class subsections offered in Fall 2020. For example, a lecture class with 800 students who
     met at another time in 40 separate labs with 20 students should be counted once in the “100+” column in
     the class section column and 40 times under the “20-29” column of the class subsections table.

                                    J. Disciplinary areas of DEGREES CONFERRED
J1 Degrees conferred between July 1, 2019 and June 30, 2020
   For each of the following discipline areas, provide the percentage of diplomas/certificates, associate, and bachelor’s degrees awarded. To
   determine the percentage, use majors, not headcount (e.g., students with one degree but a double major will be represented twice).
   Calculate the percentage from your institution’s IPEDS Completions by using the sum of 1st and 2nd majors for each CIP code as the
   numerator and the sum of the Grand Total by 1st Majors and the Grand Total by 2nd major as the denominator. If you prefer, you can
   compute the percentages using 1st majors only.
