G1 Undergraduate full-time tuition, required fees, room and board List the typical tuition, required
   fees, and room and board for a full-time undergraduate student for the FULL 2013-2014 academic
   year (30 semester or 45 quarter hours for institutions that derive annual tuition by multiplying
   credit hour cost by number of credits). A full academic year refers to the period of time generally
   extending from September to June; usually equated to two semesters, two trimesters, three
   quarters, or the period covered by a four-one-four plan. Room and board is defined as double
   occupancy and 19 meals per week or the maximum meal plan. Required fees include only charges
   that all full-time students must pay that are not included in tuition (e.g., registration, health, or
   activity fees.) Do not include optional fees (e.g., parking, laboratory use).

                       I. INSTRUCTIONAL FACULTY AND CLASS SIZE
I1   Please report the number of instructional faculty members in each category for Fall 2012. Include faculty
     who are on your institution’s payroll on the census date your institution uses for IPEDS/AAUP. The
     following definition of full-time instructional faculty is used by the American Association of University
     Professors (AAUP) in its annual Faculty Compensation Survey (the part time definitions are not used by
     AAUP). Instructional Faculty is defined as those members of the instructional-research staff whose major
     regular assignment is instruction, including those with released time for research. Use the chart below to
     determine inclusions and exclusions:
                                                                                                            Full-time    Part-time

     business, or public health in which faculty teach virtually only graduate-level students. Do not count
     undergraduate or graduate student teaching assistants as faculty.

     Fall 2012 Student to Faculty ratio         9.7 to 1    (based on 6,488 students and 667 faculty).

I3   Undergraduate Class Size
     In the table below, please use the following definitions to report information about the size of classes and
     class sections offered in the Fall 2012 term.
     Class Sections: A class section is an organized course offered for credit, identified by discipline and
     number, meeting at a stated time or times in a classroom or similar setting, and not a subsection such as a
     laboratory or discussion session. Undergraduate class sections are defined as any sections in which at
     least one degree-seeking undergraduate student is enrolled for credit. Exclude distance learning classes
     and noncredit classes and individual instruction such as dissertation or thesis research, music instruction,
     or one-to-one readings. Exclude students in independent study, co-operative programs, internships, foreign
     language taped tutor sessions, practicums, and all students in one-on-one classes. Each class section
     should be counted only once and should not be duplicated because of course catalog cross-listings.

     Class Subsections: A class subsection includes any subsection of a course, such as laboratory,
     recitation, and discussion subsections that are supplementary in nature and are scheduled to meet
     separately from the lecture portion of the course. Undergraduate subsections are defined as any
     subsections of courses in which degree-seeking undergraduate students enrolled for credit. As above,
     exclude noncredit classes and individual instruction such as dissertation or thesis research, music
     instruction, or one-to-one readings. Each class subsection should be counted only once and should not be
     duplicated because of cross-listings.

Using the above definitions, please report for each of the following class-size intervals the number of class
sections and class subsections offered in Fall 2012. For example, a lecture class with 800 students who
met at another time in 40 separate labs with 20 students should be counted once in the “100+” column in
the class section column and 40 times under the “20-29” column of the class subsections table.

J1   Degrees conferred between July 1, 2011 and June 30, 2012
     For each of the following discipline areas, provide the percentage of diplomas/certificates, associate, and bachelor’s degrees
     awarded. To determine the percentage, use majors, not headcount (e.g., students with one degree but a double major will be
     represented twice). Calculate the percentage from your institution’s IPEDS Completions by using the sum of 1st and 2nd majors for
     each CIP code as the numerator and the sum of the Grand Total by 1st Majors and the Grand Total by 2nd major as the
     denominator. If you prefer, you can compute the percentages using 1st majors only.
