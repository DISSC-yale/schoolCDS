Common Data Set -- 2001-02


The Common Data Set (CDS) was developed through collaboration among publishers of college guides,
colleges and universities, representatives of higher education organizations, high school counselors, and the
National Center for Education Statistics. Many of the items and definitions in the Common Data Set will be
used on the fall surveys of several major publishers. The goal of the CDS is to improve the comparability
of data reported by colleges and to ease each institution's burden by asking questions in a standard way on
numerous surveys. We are making our response to the Common Data Set available online to show how we
reported these data.

students who departed for the following reasons: deceased, permanently disabled, armed forces, foreign aid
service of the federal government or official church missions. No other adjustments to the initial cohort
should be made.

                I. INSTRUCTIONAL FACULTY AND CLASS SIZE

I-1. Please report number of instructional faculty members in each category for Fall 2001.

with released time for research. Institutions are asked to EXCLUDE:

    1. instructional faculty in preclinical and clinical medicine
    2. administrative officers with titles such as dean of students, librarian, registrar, coach, and the like,
       even though they may devote part of their time to classroom instruction and may have faculty
       status
    3. undergraduate or graduate students who assist in the instruction of courses, but have titles such as
       teaching assistant, teaching fellow, and the like,
    4. faculty on leave without pay, and
    5. replacement faculty for faculty on sabbatical leave.

I2. Student to Faculty Ratio

Report the Fall 2001 ratio to full-time equivalent students (full-time plus 1/3 part-time) to full-time
equivalent instructional faculty (full-time plus 1/3 part-time). In the ratio calculations, EXCLUDE both
faculty and students in stand-alone graduate or professional programs such as medicine, law, veterinary,
dentistry, social work, business, or public health in which faculty teach virtually only graduate level
students. Do not count undergraduate or graduate student teaching assistants as faculty.

  Fall 2001 Student to Faculty ratio: 13 to 1.

I3. Undergraduate Class Size

In the table below. please use the following definitions to report information about the size of classes and
class sections offered in the Fall 2001 term.

Class Sections: A class section is an organized course offered for credit, identified by discipline and
number, meeting at a stated time or times in a classroom or similar setting, and not a subsection such as a
laboratory or discussion session. Undergraduate class sections are defined as any sections in which at least
one degree-seeing undergradute student is enrolled for credit. Exclude distance learning classes and non-
credit classes and individual instruciton such as dissertation or thesis research, music instruction, or one-to-
one readings. Exclude students in independent study, co-operative programs, internships, foreign language
taped tutor sessions, practicums, and all studnets in one-on-one classes. Each class section should be
counted only once and should not be duplicated because of source catalog cross-listings.

Class subsections: A class subsection includes any subsection of a course, such as laboratory, recitation,
and discussion subsections that are supplementary in nature and are scheduled to meet separately from the
lecture portion of the course. Undergraduate subsections are defined as any subsections of courses in
which degree-seeking undergraduate students enrolled for credit. As above, exclude noncredit classes and
individual instruction such as dissertation or thesis research, music instruction, or one-to-one readings.
Each class subsection should be counted only once and should not be duplicated because of cross-listings.

Using the above definitions, please report for each of the following class-size intervals the number of class
sections and class subsections offered in Fall 2001. For example, a lecture class with 800 students who met
at another time in 40 separate labs with 20 students should be counted once in the "100+" column in the
class section column and 40 times under the "20-29" column of the class subsections table.
