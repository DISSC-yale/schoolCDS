     The items in this section correspond to data elements collected by the IPEDS Web-based Data
     Collection System’s Graduation Rate Survey (GRS). For complete instructions and definitions of data
     elements, see the IPEDS GRS Forms and Instructions for the 2021-2022 Survey.
     For Bachelor's or Equivalent Institutions
     In the following section for bachelor’s or equivalent programs, please disaggregate the Fall 2014 and
     Fall 2015 cohorts (formerly CDS B4-B11) into four groups:
     • Students who received a Federal Pell Grant*
     • Recipients of a subsidized Stafford Loan who did not receive a Pell Grant
     • Students who did not receive either a Pell Grant or a subsidized Stafford Loan
     • Total (all students, regardless of Pell Grant or subsidized loan status)

     *Students who received both a Federal Pell Grant and a subsidized Stafford Loan should be reported in
     the "Recipients of a Federal Pell Grant" column.

     For each graduation rate grid below, the numbers in the first three columns for Questions A-G should
     sum to the cohort total in the fourth column (formerly CDS B4-B11).

      Report the Fall 2021 ratio of full-time equivalent students (full-time plus 1/3 part time) to full-time

      dentistry, social work, business, or public health in which faculty teach virtually only graduate-level
      students. Do not count undergraduate or graduate student teaching assistants as faculty.

I-3   Undergraduate Class Size

      In the table below, please use the following definitions to report information about the size of classes and
      class sections offered in the Fall 2021 term.

      Class Sections: A class section is an organized course offered for credit, identified by discipline and
      number, meeting at a stated time or times in a classroom or similar setting, and not a subsection such as
      a laboratory or discussion session. Undergraduate class sections are defined as any sections in which at
      least one degree-seeking undergraduate student is enrolled for credit. Exclude distance learning classes
      and noncredit classes and individual instruction such as dissertation or thesis research, music instruction,
      or one-to-one readings. Exclude students in independent study, co-operative programs, internships,
      foreign language taped tutor sessions, practicums, and all students in one-on-one classes. Each class
      section should be counted only once and should not be duplicated because of course catalog cross-
      listings.
      Class Subsections: A class subsection includes any subsection of a course, such as laboratory,
      recitation, and discussion subsections that are supplementary in nature and are scheduled to meet
      separately from the lecture portion of the course. Undergraduate subsections are defined as any
      subsections of courses in which degree-seeking undergraduate students enrolled for credit. As above,
      exclude noncredit classes and individual instruction such as dissertation or thesis research, music
      instruction, or one-to-one readings. Each class subsection should be counted only once and should not
      be duplicated because of cross-listings.

Using the above definitions, please report for each of the following class-size intervals the number of
class sections and class subsections offered in Fall 2021. For example, a lecture class with 800 students
who met at another time in 40 separate labs with 20 students should be counted once in the “100+”
column in the class section column and 40 times under the “20-29” column of the class subsections

                                       J. Degrees Conferred

J1   Degrees Conferred between July 1, 2020 and June 30, 2021.
     For each of the following discipline areas, provide the percentage of diplomas/certificates, associate, and
     bachelor’s degrees awarded. To determine the percentage, use majors, not headcount (e.g., students with
     one degree but a double major will be represented twice). Calculate the percentage from your institution’s
     IPEDS Completions by using the sum of 1st and 2nd majors for each CIP code as the numerator and the
     sum of the Grand Total by 1st Majors and the Grand Total by 2nd major as the denominator. If you prefer,
     you can compute the percentages using 1st majors only.

often by attending summer sessions and carrying extra courses during the regular academic term.

Admitted student: Applicant who is offered admission to a degree-granting program at your institution.

who have started college for the first time, or who are re-entering after a lapse of a few years.

Financial Aid Definitions

Awarded aid: The dollar amounts offered to financial aid applicants.
External scholarships and grants: Scholarships and grants received from outside (private) sources that
students bring with them (e.g., Kiwanis, National Merit scholarships). The institution may process paperwork to
receive the dollars, but it has no role in determining the recipient or the dollar amount awarded.
Financial aid applicant: Any applicant who submits any one of the institutionally required financial aid
applications/forms, such as the FAFSA.
Indebtedness: Aggregate dollar amount borrowed through any loan program (federal, state, subsidized,
unsubsidized, private, etc.; excluding parent loans) while the student was enrolled at an institution. Student
loans co-signed by a parent are assumed to be the responsibility of the student and should be included.
Institutional scholarships and grants: Endowed scholarships, annual gifts and tuition funded grants for which
the institution determines the recipient.
Financial need: As determined by your institution using the federal methodology and/or your institution's own
standards.
Need-based aid: College-funded or college-administered award from institutional, state, federal, or other
sources for which a student must have financial need to qualify. This includes both institutional and
noninstitutional student aid (grants, jobs, and loans).
Need-based scholarship or grant aid: Scholarships and grants from institutional, state, federal, or other
sources for which a student must have financial need to qualify.
Need-based self-help aid: Loans and jobs from institutional, state, federal, or other sources for which a
student must demonstrate financial need to qualify.
Non-need-based scholarship or grant aid: Scholarships and grants, gifts, or merit-based aid from
institutional, state, federal, or other sources (including unrestricted funds or gifts and endowment income)
awarded solely on the basis of academic achievement, merit, or any other non-need-based reason. When
reporting questions H1 and H2, non-need-based aid that is used to meet need should be counted as need-
based aid.
