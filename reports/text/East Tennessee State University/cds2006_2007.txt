                                                   H. FINANCIAL AID

Please refer to the following financial aid definitions when completing Section H.

Awarded aid: The dollar amounts offered to financial aid applicants.

Financial aid applicant: Any applicant who submits any one of the institutionally required financial aid applications/forms,
such as the FAFSA.

Indebtedness: Aggregate dollar amount borrowed through any loan program (federal, state, subsidized, unsubsidized,
private, etc.; excluding parent loans) while the student was enrolled at an institution. Student loans co-signed by a parent are
assumed to be the responsibility of the student and should be included.

Institutional scholarships and grants: Endowed scholarships, annual gifts and tuition funded grants for which the
institution determines the recipient.

Financial need: As determined by your institution using the federal methodology and/or your institution's own standards.

Need-based aid: College-funded or college-administered award from institutional, state, federal, or other sources for which
a student must have financial need to qualify. This includes both institutional and noninstitutional student aid (grants, jobs,
and loans).

Need-based scholarship or grant aid: Scholarships and grants from institutional, state, federal, or other sources for which a
student must have financial need to qualify.

Need-based self-help aid: Loans and jobs from institutional, state, federal, or other sources for which a student must
demonstrate financial need to qualify.

Non-need-based scholarship or grant aid: Scholarships and grants, gifts, or merit-based aid from institutional, state,
federal, or other sources (including unrestricted funds or gifts and endowment income) awarded solely on the basis of
academic achievement, merit, or any other non-need-based reason. When reporting questions H1 and H2, non-need-based
aid that is used to meet need should be counted as need-based aid.

    Note: Suggested order of precedence for counting non-need money as need-based:
    Non-need institutional grants
    Non-need tuition waivers
    Non-need athletic awards
    Non-need federal grants
    Non-need state grants
    Non-need outside grants
    Non-need student loans
    Non-need parent loans
    Non-need work

Non-need-based self-help aid: Loans and jobs from institutional, state, or other sources for which a student need not
demonstrate financial need to qualify.

External scholarships and grants: Scholarships and grants received from outside (private) sources that students bring with
them (e.g., Kiwanis, National Merit scholarships). The institution may process paperwork to receive the dollars, but it has no
role in determining the recipient or the dollar amount awarded.

Work study and employment: Federal and state work study aid, and any employment packaged by your institution in
financial aid awards.

                                         Common Data Set 2006-07


Aid Awarded to Enrolled Undergraduates

H1. Enter total dollar amounts awarded to enrolled full-time and less than full-time degree-seeking undergraduates (using
    the same cohort reported in CDS Question B1, “total degree-seeking” undergraduates) in the following categories.
    (Note: If the data being reported are final figures for the 2005-2006 academic year (see the next item below), use the
    2005-2006 academic year's CDS Question B1 cohort.) Include aid awarded to international students (i.e., those not
    qualifying for federal aid). Aid that is non-need-based but that was used to meet need should be reported in the
    need-based aid column. (For a suggested order of precedence in assigning categories of aid to cover need, see the
    entry for “non-need-based scholarship or grant aid” on the last page of the definitions section.)

    Indicate the academic year for which data are reported for items H1, H2, H2A, and H6 below:

I-2. Student to Faculty Ratio

Report the fall 2006 ratio of full-time equivalent students (full-time plus 1/3 part time) to full-time equivalent instructional
faculty (full time plus 1/3 part time). In the ratio calculations, exclude both faculty and students in stand-alone graduate or
professional programs such as medicine, law, veterinary, dentistry, social work, business, or public health in which faculty
teach virtually only graduate level students. Do not count undergraduate or graduate student teaching assistants as faculty.

Fall 2006 Student to Faculty ratio: 17.67 to 1 (based on 10471.33 students and 592.67 faculty).

I-3. Undergraduate Class Size

In the table below, please use the following definitions to report information about the size of classes and class sections
offered in the fall 2006 term.

Class Sections: A class section is an organized course offered for credit, identified by discipline and number, meeting at a
stated time or times in a classroom or similar setting, and not a subsection such as a laboratory or discussion session.
Undergraduate class sections are defined as any sections in which at least one degree-seeking undergraduate student is
enrolled for credit. Exclude distance learning classes and noncredit classes and individual instruction such as dissertation or
thesis research, music instruction, or one-to-one readings. Exclude students in independent study, co-operative programs,
internships, foreign language taped tutor sessions, practicums, and all students in one-on-one classes. Each class section
should be counted only once and should not be duplicated because of course catalog cross-listings.

Class Subsections: A class subsection includes any subsection of a course, such as laboratory, recitation, and discussion
subsections that are supplementary in nature and are scheduled to meet separately from the lecture portion of the course.
Undergraduate subsections are defined as any subsections of courses in which degree-seeking undergraduate students
enrolled for credit. As above, exclude noncredit classes and individual instruction such as dissertation or thesis research,
music instruction, or one-to-one readings. Each class subsection should be counted only once and should not be duplicated
because of cross-listings.

Using the above definitions, please report for each of the following class-size intervals the number of class sections and
class subsections offered in fall 2006. For example, a lecture class with 800 students who met at another time in 40 separate
labs with 20 students should be counted once in the “100+” column in the class section column and 40 times under the “20-
29” column of the class subsections table.

                                    J. Disciplinary areas of DEGREES CONFERRED

Degrees conferred between July 1, 2005 and June 30, 2006

For each of the following discipline areas, provide the percentage of diplomas/certificates, associate, and bachelor’s degrees
awarded. To determine the percentage, use majors, not headcount (e.g., students with one degree but a double major will be
represented twice). Calculate the percentage from your institution’s IPEDS Completions by using the sum of 1st and 2nd
majors for each CIP code as the numerator and the sum of the Grand Total by 1st Majors and the Grand Total by 2nd major
as the denominator. If you prefer, you can compute the percentages using 1st majors only.

regular meetings, helps the student plan and implement immediate and long-term academic and vocational goals.
Accelerated program: Completion of a college program of study in fewer than the usual number of years, most often by
attending summer sessions and carrying extra courses during the regular academic term.
Admitted student: Applicant who is offered admission to a degree-granting program at your institution.

*Adult student services: Admission assistance, support, orientation, and other services expressly for adults who have
started college for the first time, or who are re-entering after a lapse of a few years.
American Indian or Alaska native: A person having origins in any of the original peoples of North America and who

actions: admission, nonadmission, placement on waiting list, or application withdrawn (by applicant or institution).

Application fee: That amount of money that an institution charges for processing a student’s application for acceptance.
This amount is not creditable toward tuition and required fees, nor is it refundable if the student is not admitted to the
institution.

Asian or Pacific Islander: A person having origins in any of the original peoples of the Far East, Southeast Asia, the Indian
Subcontinent, or Pacific Islands. This includes people from China, Japan, Korea, the Philippine Islands, American Samoa,

Associate degree: An award that normally requires at least two but less than four years of full-time equivalent college work.

Bachelor’s degree: An award (baccalaureate or equivalent degree, as determined by the Secretary of the U.S. Department of
Education) that normally requires at least four years but not more than five years of full-time equivalent college-level work.
This includes ALL bachelor’s degrees conferred in a five-year cooperative (work-study plan) program. (A cooperative plan
provides for alternate class attendance and employment in business, industry, or government; thus, it allows students to
combine actual work experience with their college studies.) Also, it includes bachelor’s degrees in which the normal four
years of work are completed in three years.

Black, non-Hispanic: A person having origins in any of the black racial groups of Africa (except those of Hispanic origin).

Board (charges): Assume average cost for 19 meals per week or the maximum meal plan.

Books and supplies (costs): Average cost of books and supplies. Do not include unusual costs for special groups of students
(e.g., engineering or art majors), unless they constitute the majority of students at your institution.

Calendar system: The method by which an institution structures most of its courses for the academic year.
*Career and placement services: A range of services, including (often) the following: coordination of visits of employers
to campus; aptitude and vocational testing; interest inventories, personal counseling; help in resume writing, interviewing,
launching the job search; listings for those students desiring employment and those seeking permanent positions;
establishment of a permanent reference folder; career resource materials.
Carnegie units: One year of study or the equivalent in a secondary school subject.

basis of grade-point average, whether weighted or unweighted.

College-preparatory program: Courses in academic subjects (English, history and social studies, foreign languages,
mathematics, science, and the arts) that stress preparation for college or university study.

Common Application: The standard application form distributed by the National Association of Secondary School
Principals for a large number of private colleges who are members of the Common Application Group.
*Community service program: Referral center for students wishing to perform volunteer work in the community or
participate in volunteer activities coordinated by academic departments.
Commuter: A student who lives off campus in housing that is not owned by, operated by, or affiliated with the college. This
category includes students who commute from home and students who have moved to the area to attend college.

Contact hour: A unit of measure that represents an hour of scheduled instruction given to students. Also referred to as clock
hour.

Continuous basis (for program enrollment): A calendar system classification that is used by institutions that enroll
students at any time during the academic year. For example, a cosmetology school or a word processing school might allow
students to enroll and begin studies at various times, with no requirement that classes begin on a certain date.

Cooperative education program: A program that provides for alternate class attendance and employment in business,
industry, or government.

Cooperative housing: College-owned, -operated, or -affiliated housing in which students share room and board expenses
and participate in household chores to reduce living expenses.

or personal development.

Credit: Recognition of attendance or performance in an instructional activity (course or program) that can be applied by a
recipient toward the requirements for a degree, diploma, certificate, or other formal award.

Credit course: A course that, if successfully completed, can be applied toward the number of courses required for achieving
a degree, diploma, certificate, or other formal award.

Credit hour: A unit of measure representing an hour (50 minutes) of instruction over a 15-week period in a semester or
trimester system or a 10-week period in a quarter system. It is applied toward the total number of hours needed for
completing the requirements of a degree, diploma, certificate, or other formal award.

Cross-registration: A system whereby students enrolled at one institution may take courses at another institution without
having to apply to the second institution.

Deferred admission: The practice of permitting admitted students to postpone enrollment, usually for a period of one
academic term or one year.

Degree: An award conferred by a college, university, or other postsecondary education institution as official recognition for
the successful completion of a program of studies.

Degree-seeking students: Students enrolled in courses for credit who are recognized by the institution as seeking a degree
or formal award. At the undergraduate level, this is intended to include students enrolled in vocational or occupational
programs.

Differs by program (calendar system): A calendar system classification that is used by institutions that have
occupational/vocational programs of varying length. These schools may enroll students at specific times depending on the

                                        Common Data Set 2006-07


program desired. For example, a school might offer a two-month program in January, March, May, September, and
November; and a three-month program in January, April, and October.

Diploma: See Postsecondary award, certificate, or diploma.

Distance learning: An option for earning course credit at off-campus locations via cable television, internet, satellite classes,

school. Students are not required to apply for admission to the college in order to participate.

Early action plan: An admission plan that allows students to apply and be notified of an admission decision well in advance
of the regular notification dates. If admitted, the candidate is not committed to enroll; the student may reply to the offer
under the college’s regular reply policy.

Early admission: A policy under which students who have not completed high school are admitted and enroll full time in
college, usually after completion of their junior year.

Early decision plan: A plan that permits students to apply and be notified of an admission decision (and financial aid offer
if applicable) well in advance of the regular notification date. Applicants agree to accept an offer of admission and, if
