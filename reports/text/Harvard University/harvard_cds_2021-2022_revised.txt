     The items in this section correspond to data elements collected by the IPEDS Web-based Data Collection
     System’s Graduation Rate Survey (GRS).

     •    For complete instructions and definitions of data elements, see the IPEDS GRS Forms and Instructions
          for the 2021-2022 Survey. https://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/use-the-data/survey-components/9/graduation-rates
     In the following section for bachelor’s or equivalent programs, please disaggregate the Fall 2014 and Fall
     2015 cohorts (formerly CDS B4-B11) into four groups:
     •    Students who received a Federal Pell Grant*
     •    Recipients of a subsidized Stafford Loan who did not receive a Pell Grant
     •    Students who did not receive either a Pell Grant or a subsidized Stafford Loan
     •    Total (all students, regardless of Pell Grant or subsidized loan status)

     *Students who received both a Federal Pell Grant and a subsidized Stafford Loan should be reported in the
     "Recipients of a Federal Pell Grant" column.

     For each graduation rate grid below, the numbers in the first three columns for Questions A-G should sum to the
     cohort total in the fourth column (formerly CDS B4-B11).

                                             H. FINANCIAL AID

     Please refer to the following financial aid definitions when completing Section H.
     Awarded aid: The dollar amounts offered to financial aid applicants.
     Financial aid applicant: Any applicant who submits any one of the institutionally required financial aid
     applications/forms, such as the FAFSA.
     Indebtedness: Aggregate dollar amount borrowed through any loan program (federal, state, subsidized,
     unsubsidized, private, etc.; excluding parent loans) while the student was enrolled at an institution. Student
     loans co-signed by a parent are assumed to be the responsibility of the student and should be included.
     Institutional scholarships and grants: Endowed scholarships, annual gifts and tuition funded grants for which
     the institution determines the recipient.
     Financial need: As determined by your institution using the federal methodology and/or your institution's own
     standards.
     Need-based aid: College-funded or college-administered award from institutional, state, federal, or other
     sources for which a student must have financial need to qualify. This includes both institutional and non-
     institutional student aid (grants, jobs, and loans).
     Need-based scholarship or grant aid: Scholarships and grants from institutional, state, federal, or other
     sources for which a student must have financial need to qualify.
     Need-based self-help aid: Loans and jobs from institutional, state, federal, or other sources for which a
     student must demonstrate financial need to qualify.
     Non-need-based scholarship or grant aid: Scholarships and grants, gifts, or merit-based aid from institutional,
     state, federal, or other sources (including unrestricted funds or gifts and endowment income) awarded solely on
     the basis of academic achievement, merit, or any other non-need-based reason. When reporting questions H1
     and H2, non-need-based aid that is used to meet need should be counted as need-based aid.

           Note: Suggested order of precedence for counting non-need money as need-based:
            1. Non-need institutional grants              6. Non-need outside grants
            2. Non-need tuition waivers                   7. Non-need student loans
            3. Non-need athletic awards                   8. Non-need parent loans
            4. Non-need federal grants                    9. Non-need work
            5. Non-need state grants
     Non-need-based self-help aid: Loans and jobs from institutional, state, or other sources for which a student
     need not demonstrate financial need to qualify.
     Private student loans: A nonfederal loan made by a lender such as a bank, credit union or private lender
     used to pay for up to the annual cost of education, less any financial aid received.
     External scholarships and grants: Scholarships and grants received from outside (private) sources that
     students bring with them (e.g., Kiwanis, National Merit scholarships). The institution may process paperwork to
     receive the dollars, but it has no role in determining the recipient or the dollar amount awarded.
     Work study and employment: Federal and state work study aid, and any employment packaged by your
     institution in financial aid awards.

     DO NOT INCLUDE ANY AID RELATED TO THE CARES ACT OR UNIQUE THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC

     Aid Awarded to Enrolled Undergraduates

H1   Enter total dollar amounts awarded to enrolled full-time and less than full-time degree-seeking undergraduates
     (using the same cohort reported in CDS Question B1, “total degree-seeking” undergraduates) in the
     following categories.
     •   If the data being reported are final figures for the 2020-2021 academic year (see the next item below),
         use the 2020-2021 academic year's CDS Question B1 cohort.
     •   Include aid awarded to international students (i.e., those not qualifying for federal aid).
     •   Aid that is non-need-based but that was used to meet need should be reported in the need-based aid
         column.
     •   For a suggested order of precedence in assigning categories of aid to cover need, see the entry for “non-
         need-based scholarship or grant aid” on the last page of the definitions section.
     •   Do NOT include any aid related to the CARES Act or unique to the COVID-19 pandemic.

I-2. Student to Faculty Ratio
     Report the Fall 2021 ratio of full-time equivalent students (full-time plus 1/3 part time) to full-time equivalent
     instructional faculty (full time plus 1/3 part time). In the ratio calculations, exclude both faculty and students in
     stand-alone graduate or professional programs such as medicine, law, veterinary, dentistry, social work,
     business, or public health in which faculty teach virtually only graduate level students.
          • Do not count undergraduate or graduate student teaching assistants as faculty.

I-3. Undergraduate Class Size
    In the table below, please use the following definitions to report information about the size of classes and class
    sections offered in the Fall 2021 term.
    •    Please include classes that have been moved online in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

    Class Sections: A class section is an organized course offered for credit, identified by discipline and number,
    meeting at a stated time or times in a classroom or similar setting, and not a subsection such as a laboratory or
    discussion session. Undergraduate class sections are defined as any sections in which at least one degree-
    seeking undergraduate student is enrolled for credit. Exclude distance learning classes and noncredit classes
    and individual instruction such as dissertation or thesis research, music instruction, or one-to-one readings.
    Exclude students in independent study, co-operative programs, internships, foreign language taped tutor
    sessions, practicums, and all students in one-on-one classes. Each class section should be counted only once
    and should not be duplicated because of course catalog cross-listings.
    Class Subsections: A class subsection includes any subsection of a course, such as laboratory, recitation,
    and discussion subsections that are supplementary in nature and are scheduled to meet separately from the
    lecture portion of the course. Undergraduate subsections are defined as any subsections of courses in which
    degree-seeking undergraduate students enrolled for credit. As above, exclude noncredit classes and individual
    instruction such as dissertation or thesis research, music instruction, or one-to-one readings. Each class
    subsection should be counted only once and should not be duplicated because of cross-listings.

    Using the above definitions, please report for each of the following class-size intervals the number of class
    sections and class subsections offered in Fall 2021. For example, a lecture class with 800 students who met at
    another time in 40 separate labs with 20 students should be counted once in the “100+” column in the class
    section column and 40 times under the “20-29” column of the class subsections table.

                                     J. Disciplinary areas of DEGREES CONFERRED
J1   Degrees conferred between July 1, 2020 and June 30, 2021
     For each of the following discipline areas, provide the percentage of diplomas/certificates, associate, and bachelor’s degrees awarded.
     To determine the percentage, use majors, not headcount (e.g., students with one degree but a double major will be represented twice).
     Calculate the percentage from your institution’s IPEDS Completions by using the sum of 1st and 2nd majors for each CIP code as the
     numerator and the sum of the Grand Total by 1st Majors and the Grand Total by 2nd major as the denominator. If you prefer, you can
     compute the percentages using 1st majors only.
