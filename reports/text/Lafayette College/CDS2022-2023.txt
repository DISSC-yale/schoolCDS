    9Include international students only in the category "Nonresident."
    9Complete the ‚ÄúTotal Undergraduates‚Äù column only if you cannot provide data for the first two columns.

    9New guidance from IPEDS for reporting aggregate data:
    Racial/ethnic destinations are requested only for United States citizens, residents, and other eligible non-citizens.
    Eligible non-citizens include all students who completed high school or a GED equivalency within the United
    States (including DACA and undocumented students) and who were not an F-1 non-immigrant student visa at
    the time of high school graduation.
    More information about other eligible (for financial aid purposes) non-citizens is available at
    https://studentaid.gov/understandaid/eligibility/requirements/non-us-citizens.
    Nonresident ‚Äì A person who is not a citizen or national of the United States and who is in this country on a
    student visa or temporary basis and does not have the right to remain indefinitely. Do not include DACA,
    undocumented, or other eligible noncitizens in this category.
    NOTE ‚Äì Nonresidents are to be reported separately, in the boxes provided, rather than included in any of the
    seven racial/ethnic categories or in race/ethnicity unknown.

          for the 2022-2023 Survey. https://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/use-the-data/survey-components/9/graduation-rates

In the following section for bachelor‚Äôs or equivalent programs, please disaggregate the Fall 201 and Fall
201 cohorts (formerly CDS B4-B11) into four groups:

     x   Students who received a Federal Pell Grant*
     x   Recipients of a subsidized Stafford Loan who did not receive a Pell Grant
     x   Students who did not receive either a Pell Grant or a subsidized Stafford Loan
     x   Total (all students, regardless of Pell Grant or subsidized loan status)
          *     Students who received both a Federal Pell Grant and a subsidized Stafford Loan should be reported
                in the "Recipients of a Federal Pell Grant" column.

For each graduation rate grid below, the numbers in the first three columns for Questions A-G should sum to the
cohort total in the fourth column (formerly CDS B4-B11).

                                                H. FINANCIAL AID

Please refer to the following financial aid definitions when completing Section H.

Awarded aid: The dollar amounts offered to financial aid applicants.

Financial aid applicant: Any applicant who submits any one of the institutionally required financial aid
applications/forms, such as the FAFSA.

Indebtedness: Aggregate dollar amount borrowed through any loan program (federal, state, subsidized,
unsubsidized, private, etc.; excluding parent loans) while the student was enrolled at an institution. Student loans
co-signed by a parent are assumed to be the responsibility of the student and should be included.

Institutional scholarships and grants: Endowed scholarships, annual gifts and tuition funded grants for which the
institution determines the recipient.

Financial need: As determined by your institution using the federal methodology and/or your institution's own
standards.

Need-based aid: College-funded or college-administered award from institutional, state, federal, or other sources
for which a student must have financial need to qualify. This includes both institutional and non-institutional student
aid (grants, jobs, and loans).

Need-based scholarship or grant aid: Scholarships and grants from institutional, state, federal, or other sources
for which a student must have financial need to qualify.

Need-based self-help aid: Loans and jobs from institutional, state, federal, or other sources for which a student
must demonstrate financial need to qualify.

Non-need-based scholarship or grant aid: Scholarships and grants, gifts, or merit-based aid from institutional,
state, federal, or other sources (including unrestricted funds or gifts and endowment income) awarded solely on the
basis of academic achievement, merit, or any other non-need-based reason. When reporting questions H1 and H2,
non-need-based aid that is used to meet need should be counted as need-based aid.

    Note: Suggested order of precedence for counting non-need money as need-based:
              1.   Non-need institutional grants                              6.   Non-need outside grants
              2.   Non-need tuition waivers                                   7.   Non-need student loans
              3.   Non-need athletic awards                                   8.   Non-need parent loans
              4.   Non-need federal grants                                    9.   Non-need work
              5.   Non-need state grants

Non-need-based self-help aid: Loans and jobs from institutional, state, or other sources for which a student need
not demonstrate financial need to qualify.
Private student loans: A nonfederal loan made by a lender such as a bank, credit union or private lender used to
pay for up to the annual cost of education, less any financial aid received.

External scholarships and grants: Scholarships and grants received from outside (private) sources that students
bring with them (e.g., Kiwanis, National Merit scholarships). The institution may process paperwork to receive the
dollars, but it has no role in determining the recipient or the dollar amount awarded.

Work study and employment: Federal and state work study aid, and any employment packaged by your institution
in financial aid awards.

DO NOT INCLUDE ANY AID RELATED TO THE CARES ACT OR UNIQUE THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC

H15. If your institution has recently implemented any major financial aid policy, program, or initiative to make your
institution more affordable to incoming students such as replacing loans with grants, or waiving costs for families
below a certain income level please provide details below:
                  Domestic students who attend high schools in which more than 75% of students qualify for free or reduced-price meals will not be
                  required to complete the CSS PROFILE in order to qualify for financial aid. Families with total income less than $150,000 with typical
                  assets now meet the no-loan threshold (was previously $50,000).

I-3. Undergraduate Class Size

In the table below, please use the following definitions to report information about the size of classes and class
sections offered in the Fall 2022 term.

    9   Please include classes that have been moved online in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Class Sections: A class section is an organized course offered for credit, identified by discipline and number,
meeting at a stated time or times in a classroom or similar setting, and not a subsection such as a laboratory or
discussion session. Undergraduate class sections are defined as any sections in which at least one degree-seeking
undergraduate student is enrolled for credit. Exclude distance learning classes and noncredit classes and individual
instruction such as dissertation or thesis research, music instruction, or one-to-one readings. Exclude students in
independent study, co-operative programs, internships, foreign language taped tutor sessions, practicums, and all
students in one-on-one classes. Each class section should be counted only once and should not be duplicated
because of course catalog cross-listings.

Class Subsections: A class subsection includes any subsection of a course, such as laboratory, recitation, and
discussion subsections that are supplementary in nature and are scheduled to meet separately from the lecture
portion of the course. Undergraduate subsections are defined as any subsections of courses in which degree-
seeking undergraduate students enrolled for credit. As above, exclude noncredit classes and individual instruction
such as dissertation or thesis research, music instruction, or one-to-one readings. Each class subsection should be
counted only once and should not be duplicated because of cross-listings.

Using the above definitions, please report for each of the following class-size intervals the number of class sections
and class subsections offered in Fall 2022. For example, a lecture class with 800 students who met at another time
in 40 separate labs with 20 students should be counted once in the ‚Äú100+‚Äù column in the class section column and
40 times under the ‚Äú20-29‚Äù column of the class subsections table.

Degrees conferred between July 1, 2021 and June 30, 2022

For each of the following discipline areas, provide the percentage of diplomas/certificates, associate, and bachelor‚Äôs
degrees awarded. To determine the percentage, use majors, not headcount (e.g., students with one degree but a
double major will be represented twice). Calculate the percentage from your institution‚Äôs IPEDS Completions by
using the sum of 1st and 2nd majors for each CIP code as the numerator and the sum of the Grand Total by 1st
Majors and the Grand Total by 2nd major as the denominator. If you prefer, you can compute the percentages using
1st majors only.

                                                 Financial Aid Definitions

External scholarships and grants: Scholarships and grants received from outside (private) sources that students bring with
them (e.g., Kiwanis, National Merit scholarships). The institution may process paperwork to receive the dollars, but it has no role
in determining the recipient or the dollar amount awarded.

Financial aid applicant: Any applicant who submits any one of the institutionally required financial aid applications/forms, such
as the FAFSA.

Indebtedness: Aggregate dollar amount borrowed through any loan program (federal, state, subsidized, unsubsidized, private,
etc.; excluding parent loans) while the student was enrolled at an institution. Student loans co-signed by a parent are assumed
to be the responsibility of the student and should be included.

Institutional scholarships and grants: Endowed scholarships, annual gifts and tuition funded grants for which the institution
determines the recipient.

Financial need: As determined by your institution using the federal methodology and/or your institution's own standards.

Need-based aid: College-funded or college-administered award from institutional, state, federal, or other sources for which a
student must have financial need to qualify. This includes both institutional and non-institutional student aid (grants, jobs, and
loans).

Need-based scholarship or grant aid: Scholarships and grants from institutional, state, federal, or other sources for which a
student must have financial need to qualify.

Need-based self-help aid: Loans and jobs from institutional, state, federal, or other sources for which a student must
demonstrate financial need to qualify.

Non-need-based scholarship or grant aid: Scholarships and grants, gifts, or merit-based aid from institutional, state, federal,
or other sources (including unrestricted funds or gifts and endowment income) awarded solely on the basis of academic
achievement, merit, or any other non-need-based reason. When reporting questions H1 and H2, non-need-based aid that is
used to meet need should be counted as need-based aid.

    Note: Suggested order of precedence for counting non-need money as need-based:

                1.   Non-need institutional grants                                      6.   Non-need outside grants
                2.   Non-need tuition waivers                                           7.   Non-need student loans
                3.   Non-need athletic awards                                           8.   Non-need parent loans
                4.   Non-need federal grants                                            9.   Non-need work
                5.   Non-need state grants
