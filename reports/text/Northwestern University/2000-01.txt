Aid Awarded to Enrolled Undergraduates

H1. Enter total dollar amounts awarded to full-time and less than full-time degree-seeking undergraduates
(using the same cohort reported in CDS Question B1, "total degree-seeking" undergraduates) in the
following categories. Include aid awarded to international students (i.e., those not qualifying for federal
aid). Aid that is non-need-based but that was used to meet need should be reported in the need-based aid
column. (For a suggested order of precedence in assigning categories of aid to cover need, see the entry
for "non-need-based gift aid" on the last page of the definitions section.)

I. Instructional faculty and class size

I-1. Please report number of instructional faculty members in each category for Fall 2000.

The following definition of instructional faculty is used by the American Association of University Professors
(AAUP) in its annual Faculty Compensation Survey. Instructional Faculty is defined as those members of the
instructional-research staff whose major regular assignment is instruction, including those with released time for
research. Institutions are asked to EXCLUDE:

    1. instructional faculty in preclinical and clinical medicine
    2. administrative officers with titles such as dean of students, librarian, registrar, coach, and the like, even
       though they may devote part of their time to classroom instruction and may have faculty status,
    3. undergraduate or graduate students who assist in the instruction of courses, but have titles such as
       teaching assistant, teaching fellow, and the like
    4. faculty on leave without pay, and
    5. replacement faculty for faculty on sabbatical leave.

Full-time: faculty employed on a full-time basis
Part-time: faculty teaching less than two semesters, three quarters, two trimesters, or two four-month sessions.
Also includes adjuncts and part-time instructors.
Minority faculty: includes faculty who designate themselves as black, non-Hispanic; American Indian or Alaskan
native; Asian or Pacific Islander; or Hispanic.
Doctorate: includes such degrees as Doctor of Education, Doctor of Juridical Science, Doctor of Public Health,
and Doctor of Philosophy degree in any field such as agronomy, food technology, education, engineering, public
administration, ophthalmology, or radiology.
First-professional: includes the fields of dentistry (DDS or DMD), medicine (MD), optometry (OD), osteopathic
medicine (DO), pharmacy (DPharm or BPharm), podiatric medicine (DPM), veterinary medicine (DVM),
chiropractic (DC or DCM), law (JD) and theological professions (MDiv, MHL).
Terminal degree: the highest degree in a field: example, M. Arch (architecture) and MFA (master of fine arts).

                                                                                           Full-time Part-time Total

I-2. Student to Faculty Ratio

Report the Fall 2000 ratio of full-time equivalent students (full-time plus 1/3 part time) to full-time equivalent
instructional faculty (full time plus 1/3 part time). In the ratio calculations, exclude both faculty and students in
stand-alone graduate or professional programs such as medicine, law, veterinary, dentistry, social work, business,
or public health in which faculty teach virtually only graduate level students. Do not count undergraduate or
graduate student teaching assistants as faculty.

Fall 2000 Student to Faculty ratio: 7 to 1.

I-3. Undergraduate Class Size

In the table below, please use the following definitions to report information about the size of classes and class
sections offered in the Fall 2000 term.

Class Sections: A class section is an organized course offered for credit, identified by discipline and number,
meeting at a stated time or times in a classroom or similar setting, and not a subsection such as a laboratory or
discussion session. Undergraduate class sections are defined as any sections in which at least one degree-
seeking undergraduate student is enrolled for credit. Exclude distance learning classes and noncredit classes and
individual instruction such as dissertation or thesis research, music instruction, or one-to-one readings. Exclude
students in independent study, co-operative programs, internships, foreign language taped tutor sessions,
practicums, and all students in one-on-one classes. Each class section should be counted only once and should
not be duplicated because of course catalog cross-listings.

Class Subsections: A class subsection includes any subsection of a course, such as laboratory, recitation, and
discussion subsections that are supplementary in nature and are scheduled to meet separately from the lecture
portion of the course. Undergraduate subsections are defined as any subsections of courses in which degree-
seeking undergraduate students enrolled for credit. As above, exclude noncredit classes and individual instruction
such as dissertation or thesis research, music instruction, or one-to-one readings. Each class subsection should
be counted only once and should not be duplicated because of cross-listings.

Using the above definitions, please report for each of the following class-size intervals the number of class
sections and class subsections offered in Fall 2000. For example, a lecture class with 800 students who met at
another time in 40 separate labs with 20 students should be counted once in the "100+" column in the class
section column and 40 times under the "20-29" column of the class subsections table.

who, through regular meetings, helps the student plan and implement immediate and long-term academic and
vocational goals.

Accelerated program: Completion of a college program of study in fewer than the usual number of years, most
often by attending summer sessions and carrying extra courses during the regular academic term.

Admitted student: Applicant who is offered admission to a degree-granting program at your institution.

Financial aid definitions

Financial aid applicant: Any applicant who submits any one of the institutionally required financial aid
applications/forms, such as the FAFSA.

Indebtedness: Aggregate dollar amount borrowed through any loan programs (federal, state, subsidized,
unsubsidized, private, etc.; excluding parent loans) while the student was enrolled at an institution. Student loans
co-signed by a parent are assumed to be the responsibility of the student and should be included.

Institutional and external funds: Endowment, alumni, or external monies for which the institution determines the
recipient or the dollar amount awarded.

Financial need: As determined by your institution using the federal methodology and/or your institution's own
standards.

Need-based aid: College-funded or college-administered award from institutional, state, federal, or other sources
for which a student must have financial need to qualify. This includes both institutional and noninstitutional student
aid (grants, jobs, and loans).

Need-based gift aid: Scholarships and grants from institutional, state, federal, or other sources for which a
student must have financial need to qualify.

Need-based self-help aid: Loans and jobs from institutional, state, federal, or other sources for which a student
must demonstrate financial need to qualify.

Non-need-based gift aid: Scholarships and grants, gifts, or merit-based aid from institutional, state, federal, or
other sources (including unrestricted funds or gifts and endowment income) awarded solely on the basis of
academic achievement, merit, or any other non-need-based reason. When reporting questions H1 and H2,
non-need-based aid that is used to meet need should be counted as need-based aid.

Note: Suggested order of precedence for counting non-need money as need-based:
Non-need institutional grants
Non-need tuition waivers
Non-need athletic awards
Non-need federal grants
Non-need state grants
Non-need outside grants
Non-need student loans
Non-need parent loans
Non-need work

Non-need-based self-help aid: Loans and jobs from institutional, state, or other sources for which a student need
not demonstrate financial need to qualify.

Scholarships/grants from external sources: Monies received from outside (private) sources that the student
brings with them (e.g., Kiwanis, National Merit scholarships). The institution may process paperwork to receive the
dollars, but it has no role in determining the recipient or the dollar amount awarded.

Work study and employment: Federal and state work study aid, and any employment packaged by your
institution in financial aid awards.
