   academic year costs of attendance will be available:


G1. Undergraduate full-time tuition, required fees, room and board

List the typical tuition, required fees, and room and board for a full-time undergraduate student for the FULL
2010-2011 academic year (30 semester hours or 45 quarter hours for institutions that derive annual tuition by
multiplying credit hour cost by number of credits). A full academic year refers to the period of time generally
extending from September to June; usually equated to two semesters, two trimesters, three quarters, or the period
covered by a four-one-four plan. Room and board is defined as double occupancy and 19 meals per week or the
maximum meal plan. Required fees include only charges that all full-time students must pay that are not included
in tuition (e.g., registration, health, or activity fees.) Do not include optional fees (e.g., parking, laboratory use).

I-2. Student to Faculty Ratio

Report the Fall 2009 ratio of full-time equivalent students (full-time plus 1/3 part time) to full-time equivalent
instructional faculty (full time plus 1/3 part time). In the ratio calculations, exclude both faculty and students in
stand-alone graduate or professional programs such as medicine, law, veterinary, dentistry, social work, business,
or public health in which faculty teach virtually only graduate level students. Do not count undergraduate or
graduate student teaching assistants as faculty.

Fall 2009 Student to Faculty ratio: 7 to 1 (based on 7,933 students and 1,134 faculty).

I-3. Undergraduate Class Size

In the table below, please use the following definitions to report information about the size of classes and class
sections offered in the Fall 2009 term.

Class Sections: A class section is an organized course offered for credit, identified by discipline and number,
meeting at a stated time or times in a classroom or similar setting, and not a subsection such as a laboratory or
discussion session. Undergraduate class sections are defined as any sections in which at least one degree-
seeking undergraduate student is enrolled for credit. Exclude distance learning classes and noncredit classes and
individual instruction such as dissertation or thesis research, music instruction, or one-to-one readings. Exclude
students in independent study, co-operative programs, internships, foreign language taped tutor sessions,
practicums, and all students in one-on-one classes. Each class section should be counted only once and should

not be duplicated because of course catalog cross-listings.

Class Subsections: A class subsection includes any subsection of a course, such as laboratory, recitation, and
discussion subsections that are supplementary in nature and are scheduled to meet separately from the lecture
portion of the course. Undergraduate subsections are defined as any subsections of courses in which degree-
seeking undergraduate students enrolled for credit. As above, exclude noncredit classes and individual instruction
such as dissertation or thesis research, music instruction, or one-to-one readings. Each class subsection should
be counted only once and should not be duplicated because of cross-listings.

Using the above definitions, please report for each of the following class-size intervals the number of class
sections and class subsections offered in Fall 2009. For example, a lecture class with 800 students who met at
another time in 40 separate labs with 20 students should be counted once in the "100+" column in the class
section column and 40 times under the "20-29" column of the class subsections table.

J. Degrees conferred

Degrees conferred between July 1, 2008 and June 30, 2009

For each of the following discipline areas, provide the percentage of diplomas/certificates, associate, and
bachelor's degrees awarded. To determine the percentage, use majors, not headcount (e.g., students with one
degree but a double major will be represented twice). Calculate the percentage from your institution's IPEDS
Completions by using the sum of 1st and 2nd majors for each CIP code as the numerator and the sum of the
Grand Total by 1st Majors and the Grand Total by 2nd major as the denominator. If you prefer, you can compute
the percentages using 1st majors only.

bring with them (e.g., Kiwanis, National Merit scholarships). The institution may process paperwork to receive the
dollars, but it has no role in determining the recipient or the dollar amount awarded.

Financial aid applicant: Any applicant who submits any one of the institutionally required financial aid
applications/forms, such as the FAFSA.

Indebtedness: Aggregate dollar amount borrowed through any loan programs (federal, state, subsidized,
unsubsidized, private, etc.; excluding parent loans) while the student was enrolled at an institution. Student loans
co-signed by a parent are assumed to be the responsibility of the student and should be included.

Institutional scholarships and grants: Endowed scholarships, annual gifts and tuition funded grants for which
the institution determines the recipient.

Financial need: As determined by your institution using the federal methodology and/or your institution's own
standards.

Need-based aid: College-funded or college-administered award from institutional, state, federal, or other sources
for which a student must have financial need to qualify. This includes both institutional and noninstitutional student
aid (grants, jobs, and loans).

Need-based gift aid: Scholarships and grants from institutional, state, federal, or other sources for which a
student must have financial need to qualify.

Need-based self-help aid: Loans and jobs from institutional, state, federal, or other sources for which a student
must demonstrate financial need to qualify.

Non-need-based gift aid: Scholarships and grants, gifts, or merit-based aid from institutional, state, federal, or
other sources (including unrestricted funds or gifts and endowment income) awarded solely on the basis of
academic achievement, merit, or any other non-need-based reason. When reporting questions H1 and H2,
non-need-based aid that is used to meet need should be counted as need-based aid.

Note: Suggested order of precedence for counting non-need money as need-based:
Non-need institutional grants
Non-need tuition waivers
Non-need athletic awards
Non-need federal grants
Non-need state grants
Non-need outside grants
Non-need student loans
Non-need parent loans
Non-need work

Non-need-based self-help aid: Loans and jobs from institutional, state, or other sources for which a student need
not demonstrate financial need to qualify.

Scholarships/grants from external sources: Monies received from outside (private) sources that the student
brings with them (e.g., Kiwanis, National Merit scholarships). The institution may process paperwork to receive the
dollars, but it has no role in determining the recipient or the dollar amount awarded.

Work study and employment: Federal and state work study aid, and any employment packaged by your

institution in financial aid awards.
