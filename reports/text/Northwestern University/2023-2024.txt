B2. Enrollment by Racial/Ethnic Category.
Provide numbers of undergraduate students for each of the following categories as of the institution’s official fall
reporting date or as of October 15, 2023.
    Include international students only in the category "Nonresidents."
    Complete the “Total Undergraduates” column only if you cannot provide data for the first two columns.
    Report as your institution reports to IPEDS: persons who are Hispanic should be reported only on the
        Hispanic line, not under any race, and persons who are non-Hispanic multi-racial should be reported only
        under "Two or more races."
    New guidance from IPEDS for reporting aggregate data:
   Racial/ethnic designations are requested only for United States citizens, residents, and other eligible non-
   citizens.
   Eligible non-citizens include all students who completed high school or a GED equivalency within the
   United States (including DACA and undocumented students) and who were not on an F-1 non-immigrant
   student visa at the time of high school graduation.

   More information about other eligible (for financial aid purposes) non-citizens is available at
   https://studentaid.gov/understand-aid/eligibility/requirements/non-us-citizens.

   Nonresident – A person who is not a citizen or national of the United States and who is in this country on a
   student visa or temporary basis and does not have the right to remain indefinitely. Do not include DACA,
   undocumented, or other eligible noncitizens in this category.

   NOTE - Nonresidents are to be reported separately, in the boxes provided, rather than included in
   any of the seven racial/ethnic categories or in race/ethnicity unknown.

B4-B21: Graduation Rates
The items in this section correspond to data elements collected by the IPEDS Web-based Data Collection
System’s Graduation Rate Survey (GRS).

    For complete instructions and definitions of data elements, see the IPEDS GRS Forms and Instructions
     for the 2023-2024 Survey. https://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/use-the-data/survey-components/9/graduation-rates

In the following section for bachelor’s or equivalent programs, please disaggregate the Fall 2016 and Fall
2017 cohorts (formerly CDS B4-B11) into four groups:

   •   Students who received a Federal Pell Grant*
   •   Recipients of a subsidized Stafford Loan who did not receive a Pell Grant
   •   Students who did not receive either a Pell Grant or a subsidized Stafford Loan
   •   Total (all students, regardless of Pell Grant or subsidized loan status)
       * Students who received both a Federal Pell Grant and a subsidized Stafford Loan should be reported
          in the "Recipients of a Federal Pell Grant" column.

For each graduation rate grid below, the numbers in the first three columns for Questions A-G should sum to the
cohort total in the fourth column (formerly CDS B4-B11).

                                   For Bachelor’s or Equivalent Programs
Please provide data for the Fall 2017 cohort if available. If Fall 2017 cohort data are not available, provide data
for the Fall 2016 cohort.

Report for the cohort of all full-time, first-time bachelor’s (or equivalent) degree-seeking undergraduate
students who entered in Fall 2022 (or the preceding summer term).

    The initial cohort may be adjusted for students who departed for the following reasons:

           *   Death
           *   Permanent Disability
           *   Service in the armed forces
           *   Foreign aid service of the federal government
           *   Official church missions
           *   No other adjustments to the initial cohort should be made.

For the cohort of all full-time bachelor’s (or equivalent) degree-seeking undergraduate students who
entered your institution as first-year students in Fall 2022 (or the preceding summer term), what
percentage was enrolled at your institution as of the date your institution calculates its official enrollment
in Fall 2023.

Total students retained = students from the Fall 2022 cohort who are still enrolled as of Fall 2023 + students
from Fall 2022 cohort who completed their bachelor’s program as of Fall 2023

(Students from the Fall 2022 cohort still enrolled as of Fall 2023 + Students from Fall 2022 cohort who
completed their bachelor’s program as of Fall 2023)/(Adjusted Fall 2022 cohort) *100

Note: The number of first-time students seeking a bachelor’s degree (or equivalent) who attain a bachelor’s
degree (or equivalent) by their second fall term is expected to be zero or very small. In exceptional cases
when a first-time student does satisfy all degree requirements including full credit completion (e.g.,
typically 120 credit hours) and is awarded a bachelor’s degree (or equivalent) by their second fall term,
they are to be considered “retained” for EF reporting purposes.

                                            H. FINANCIAL AID
Please refer to the following financial aid definitions when completing Section H.

Awarded aid: The dollar amounts offered to financial aid applicants.

Financial aid applicant: Any applicant who submits any one of the institutionally required financial aid
applications/forms, such as the FAFSA.

Indebtedness: Aggregate dollar amount borrowed through any loan program (federal, state, subsidized,
unsubsidized, private, etc.; excluding parent loans) while the student was enrolled at an institution. Student loans
co-signed by a parent are assumed to be the responsibility of the student and should be included.

Institutional scholarships and grants: Endowed scholarships, annual gifts and tuition funded grants for which
the institution determines the recipient.

Financial need: As determined by your institution using the federal methodology and/or your institution's own
standards.

Need-based aid: College-funded or college-administered award from institutional, state, federal, or other sources
for which a student must have financial need to qualify. This includes both institutional and non-institutional
student aid (grants, jobs, and loans).

Need-based scholarship or grant aid: Scholarships and grants from institutional, state, federal, or other sources
for which a student must have financial need to qualify.

Need-based self-help aid: Loans and jobs from institutional, state, federal, or other sources for which a student
must demonstrate financial need to qualify.

Non-need-based scholarship or grant aid: Scholarships and grants, gifts, or merit-based aid from institutional,
state, federal, or other sources (including unrestricted funds or gifts and endowment income) awarded solely on
the basis of academic achievement, merit, or any other non-need-based reason. When reporting questions H1 and
H2, non-need-based aid that is used to meet need should be counted as need-based aid.

   Note: Suggested order of precedence for counting non-need money as need-based:
           1. Non-need institutional grants                     6. Non-need outside grants
           2. Non-need tuition waivers                          7. Non-need student loans
           3. Non-need athletic awards                          8. Non-need parent loans
           4. Non-need federal grants                           9. Non-need work
           5. Non-need state grants

Non-need-based self-help aid: Loans and jobs from institutional, state, or other sources for which a student need
not demonstrate financial need to qualify.
Private student loans: A nonfederal loan made by a lender such as a bank, credit union or private lender used to
pay for up to the annual cost of education, less any financial aid received.

External scholarships and grants: Scholarships and grants received from outside (private) sources that students
bring with them (e.g., Kiwanis, National Merit scholarships). The institution may process paperwork to receive
the dollars, but it has no role in determining the recipient or the dollar amount awarded.

                                     Common Data Set 2023-2024
Work study and employment: Federal and state work study aid, and any employment packaged by your
institution in financial aid awards.

DO NOT INCLUDE ANY AID RELATED TO THE CARES ACT OR UNIQUE THE COVID-19
PANDEMIC

H1-H5: Aid Awarded to Enrolled Undergraduates
H1. Enter total dollar amounts awarded to enrolled full-time and less than full-time degree-seeking
    undergraduates (using the same cohort reported in CDS Question B1, “total degree-seeking”
    undergraduates) in the following categories.
     If the data being reported are final figures for the 2022-2023 academic year (see the next item below),
        use the 2022-2023 academic year's CDS Question B1 cohort.
     Include aid awarded to international students (i.e., those not qualifying for federal aid).
     Aid that is non-need-based but that was used to meet need should be reported in the need-based aid
        column.
     For a suggested order of precedence in assigning categories of aid to cover need, see the entry for “non-
        need-based scholarship or grant aid” on the last page of the definitions section.
     Do NOT include any aid related to the CARES Act or unique to the COVID-19 pandemic.

your institution more affordable to incoming students such as replacing loans with grants, or waiving costs for
families below a certain income level please provide details below:

        ⇒ Northwestern’s commitment to affordability begins with financial aid that meets 100% of every
        student’s demonstrated financial need. At Northwestern, financial aid awards are not loans—there’s

I3. Undergraduate Class Size

In the table below, please use the following definitions to report information about the size of classes and class
sections offered in the Fall 2023 term.

    Please include classes that have been moved online in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Class Sections: A class section is an organized course offered for credit, identified by discipline and number,
meeting at a stated time or times in a classroom or similar setting, and not a subsection such as a laboratory or
discussion session. Undergraduate class sections are defined as any sections in which at least one degree-seeking
undergraduate student is enrolled for credit. Exclude distance learning classes and noncredit classes and individual
instruction such as dissertation or thesis research, music instruction, or one-to-one readings. Exclude students in
independent study, co-operative programs, internships, foreign language taped tutor sessions, practicums, and all
students in one-on-one classes. Each class section should be counted only once and should not be duplicated
because of course catalog cross-listings.

Class Subsections: A class subsection includes any subsection of a course, such as laboratory, recitation, and
discussion subsections that are supplementary in nature and are scheduled to meet separately from the lecture
portion of the course. Undergraduate subsections are defined as any subsections of courses in which degree-
seeking undergraduate students enrolled for credit. As above, exclude noncredit classes and individual instruction
such as dissertation or thesis research, music instruction, or one-to-one readings. Each class subsection should be
counted only once and should not be duplicated because of cross-listings.

Using the above definitions, please report for each of the following class-size intervals the number of class
sections and class subsections offered in Fall 2023. For example, a lecture class with 800 students who met at
another time in 40 separate labs with 20 students should be counted once in the “100+” column in the class section
column and 40 times under the “20-29” column of the class subsections table.

Degrees conferred between July 1, 2022 and June 30, 2023

For each of the following discipline areas, provide the percentage of diplomas/certificates, associate, and
bachelor’s degrees awarded. To determine the percentage, use majors, not headcount (e.g., students with one
degree but a double major will be represented twice). Calculate the percentage from your institution’s IPEDS
Completions by using the sum of 1st and 2nd majors for each CIP code as the numerator and the sum of the Grand
Total by 1st Majors and the Grand Total by 2nd major as the denominator. If you prefer, you can compute the
percentages using 1st majors only.

External scholarships and grants: Scholarships and grants received from outside (private) sources that students
bring with them (e.g., Kiwanis, National Merit scholarships). The institution may process paperwork to receive

applications/forms, such as the FAFSA.

Indebtedness: Aggregate dollar amount borrowed through any loan program (federal, state, subsidized,
unsubsidized, private, etc.; excluding parent loans) while the student was enrolled at an institution. Student loans
co-signed by a parent are assumed to be the responsibility of the student and should be included.

Institutional scholarships and grants: Endowed scholarships, annual gifts and tuition funded grants for which
the institution determines the recipient.

Financial need: As determined by your institution using the federal methodology and/or your institution's own
