B2   Enrollment by Racial/Ethnic Category.
     Provide numbers of undergraduate students for each of the following categories as of the institution’s official fall reporting
     date or as of October 15, 2022.
     • Include international students only in the category "Nonresidents."
     •   Complete the “Total Undergraduates” column only if you cannot provide data for the first two columns.
     •   Report as your institution reports to IPEDS: persons who are Hispanic should be reported only on the
         Hispanic line, not under any race, and persons who are non-Hispanic multi-racial should be reported only
         under "Two or more races."
     •   New guidance from IPEDS for reporting aggregate data:
     Racial/ethnic designations are requested only for United States citizens, residents, and other eligible non-citizens.
     Eligible non-citizens include all students who completed high school or a GED equivalency within the United States
     (including DACA and undocumented students) and who were not on an F-1 non-immigrant student visa at the time of
     high school graduation.
     More information about other eligible (for financial aid purposes) non-citizens is available at
     https://studentaid.gov/understandaid/eligibility/requirements/non-us-citizens.

     Nonresident - A person who is not a citizen or national of the United States and who is in this country on a student visa
     or temporary basis and does not have the right to remain indefinitely. Do not include DACA, undocumented, or other
     eligible noncitizens in this category.

     NOTE - Nonresidents are to be reported separately, in the boxes provided, rather than included in any of the seven
     racial/ethnic categories or in race/ethnicity unknown.

     B4-B21: Graduation Rates
     The items in this section correspond to data elements collected by the IPEDS Web-based Data Collection System’s
     Graduation Rate Survey (GRS).

     •    For complete instructions and definitions of data elements, see the IPEDS GRS Forms and Instructions
          for the 2022-2023 Survey. https://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/use-the-data/survey-components/9/graduation-rates

     In the following section for bachelor’s or equivalent programs, please disaggregate the Fall 2015 and Fall 2016
     cohorts (formerly CDS B4-B11) into four groups:
     • Students who received a Federal Pell Grant*
     • Recipients of a subsidized Stafford Loan who did not receive a Pell Grant
     • Students who did not receive either a Pell Grant or a subsidized Stafford Loan
     • Total (all students, regardless of Pell Grant or subsidized loan status)

     *Students who received both a Federal Pell Grant and a subsidized Stafford Loan should be reported in the "Recipients of a
     Federal Pell Grant" column.

     For each graduation rate grid below, the numbers in the first three columns for Questions A-G should sum to the cohort total
     in the fourth column (formerly CDS B4-B11).
                                                For Bachelor’s or Equivalent Programs

     Please provide data for the Fall 2016 cohort if available. If Fall 2016 cohort data are not available, provide data for the Fall
     2015 cohort.

      •    If you consider the highest scores from either submission, use the highest combination of scores
           (e.g., verbal from one submission, math from the other).
      •    If you average the scores, use the average to report the scores.

                                          H. FINANCIAL AID
     Please refer to the following financial aid definitions when completing Section H.
     Awarded aid: The dollar amounts offered to financial aid applicants.
     Financial aid applicant: Any applicant who submits any one of the institutionally required financial aid
     applications/forms, such as the FAFSA.
     Indebtedness: Aggregate dollar amount borrowed through any loan program (federal, state, subsidized,
     unsubsidized, private, etc.; excluding parent loans) while the student was enrolled at an institution.
     Student loans co-signed by a parent are assumed to be the responsibility of the student and should be
     included
     Institutional scholarships and grants: Endowed scholarships, annual gifts and tuition funded grants for
     which the institution determines the recipient.
     Financial need: As determined by your institution using the federal methodology and/or your institution's
     own standards.
     Need-based aid: College-funded or college-administered award from institutional, state, federal, or other
     sources for which a student must have financial need to qualify. This includes both institutional and non-
     institutional student aid (grants, jobs, and loans).
     Need-based scholarship or grant aid: Scholarships and grants from institutional, state, federal, or
     other sources for which a student must have financial need to qualify.
     Need-based self-help aid: Loans and jobs from institutional, state, federal, or other sources for which a
     student must demonstrate financial need to qualify.
     Non-need-based scholarship or grant aid: Scholarships and grants, gifts, or merit-based aid from
     institutional, state, federal, or other sources (including unrestricted funds or gifts and endowment income)
     awarded solely on the basis of academic achievement, merit, or any other non-need-based reason.
     When reporting questions H1 and H2, non-need-based aid that is used to meet need should be counted
     as need-based aid.
     Note: Suggested order of precedence for counting non-need money as need-based:
       1. Non-need institutional grants              6. Non-need outside grants
       2. Non-need tuition waivers                   7. Non-need student loans
       3. Non-need athletic awards                   8. Non-need parent loans
       4. Non-need federal grants                    9. Non-need work
       5. Non-need state grants
     Non-need-based self-help aid: Loans and jobs from institutional, state, or other sources for which a
     student need not demonstrate financial need to qualify.
     Private student loans: A nonfederal loan made by a lender such as a bank, credit union or private
     lender used to pay for up to the annual cost of education, less any financial aid received.
     External scholarships and grants: Scholarships and grants received from outside (private) sources
     that students bring with them (e.g., Kiwanis, National Merit scholarships). The institution may process
     paperwork to receive the dollars, but it has no role in determining the recipient or the dollar amount
     Work study and employment: Federal and state work study aid, and any employment packaged by
     your institution in financial aid awards.

I-3. Undergraduate Class Size
    In the table below, please use the following definitions to report information about the size of classes and
    class sections offered in the Fall 2022 term.
    • Please include classes that have been moved online in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

    Class Sections: A class section is an organized course offered for credit, identified by discipline and
    number, meeting at a stated time or times in a classroom or similar setting, and not a subsection such as
    a laboratory or discussion session. Undergraduate class sections are defined as any sections in which at
    least one degree-seeking undergraduate student is enrolled for credit. Exclude distance learning classes
    and noncredit classes and individual instruction such as dissertation or thesis research, music instruction,
    or one-to-one readings. Exclude students in independent study, co-operative programs, internships,
    foreign language taped tutor sessions, practicums, and all students in one-on-one classes. Each class
    section should be counted only once and should not be duplicated because of course catalog cross-
    listings.
    Class Subsections: A class subsection includes any subsection of a course, such as laboratory,
    recitation, and discussion subsections that are supplementary in nature and are scheduled to meet
    separately from the lecture portion of the course. Undergraduate subsections are defined as any
    subsections of courses in which degree-seeking undergraduate students enrolled for credit. As above,
    exclude noncredit classes and individual instruction such as dissertation or thesis research, music
    instruction, or one-to-one readings. Each class subsection should be counted only once and should not be
    duplicated because of cross-listings.

    Using the above definitions, please report for each of the following class-size intervals the number of
    class sections and class subsections offered in Fall 2022. For example, a lecture class with 800 students
    who met at another time in 40 separate labs with 20 students should be counted once in the “100+”
    column in the class section column and 40 times under the “20-29” column of the class subsections table.

   numerator and the sum of the Grand Total by 1st Majors and the Grand Total by 2nd major as the denominator. If you prefer, you can
   compute the percentages using 1st majors only.
