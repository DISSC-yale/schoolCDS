teaching assistant, teaching fellow, and the like,
(d) faculty on leave without pay, and
(e) replacement faculty for faculty on sabbatical leave.

     fine arts).

I2. Student to Faculty Ratio

Report the Fall 2000 ratio to full-time equivalent students (full-time plus 1/3 part-time) to full-time
equivalent instructional faculty (full-time plus 1/3 part-time). In the ratio calculations, exclude both faculty
and students in stand-alone graduate or professional programs such as medicine, law, veterinary, dentistry,
social work, business, or public health in which faculty teach virtually only graduate level students. Do not
count undergraduate or graduate student teaching assistants as faculty.

  Fall 2000 Student to Faculty ratio: 18 to 1.

I3. Undergraduate Class Size

In the table below. please use the following definitions to report information about the size of classes and
class sections offered in the Fall 2000 term.

Class Sections: A class section is an organized course offered for credit, identified by discipline and
number, meeting at a stated time or times in a classroom or similar setting, and not a subsection such as a
laboratory or discussion session. Undergraduate class sections are defined as any sections in which at least
one degree-seeing undergraduate student is enrolled for credit. Exclude distance learning classes and non-
credit classes and individual instruction such as dissertation or thesis research, music instruction, or one-to-
one readings. Exclude students in independent study, co-operative programs, internships, foreign language
taped tutor sessions, practicums, and all students in one-on-one classes. Each class section should be
counted only once and should not be duplicated because of source catalog cross-listings.

Class subsections: A class subsection includes any subsection of a course, such as laboratory, recitation,
and discussion subsections that are supplementary in nature and are scheduled to meet separately from the
lecture portion of the course. Undergraduate subsections are defined as any subsections of courses in which
degree-seeking undergraduate students enrolled for credit. As above, exclude noncredit classes and
individual instruction such as dissertation or thesis research, music instruction, or one-to-one readings. Each
class subsection should be counted only once and should not be duplicated because of cross-listings.

Using the above definitions, please report for each of the following class-size intervals the number of class
sections and class subsections offered in Fall 1999. For example, a lecture class with 800 students who met
at another time in 40 separate labs with 20 students should be counted once in the "100+" column in the class
section column and 40 times under the "20-29" column of the class subsections table.
