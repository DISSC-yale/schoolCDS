     Provide 2003-2004 academic year costs for the following categories that are applicable
     to your institution.
     This depends upon when the state budget is finalized - probably late summer.

G1 Undergraduate full-time tuition, required fees, room and board List the typical tuition,
   required fees, and room and board for a full-time undergraduate student for the FULL
   2003-2004 academic year (30 semester or 45 quarter hours for institutions that derive
   annual tuition by multiplying credit hour cost by number of credits). A full academic year
   refers to the period of time generally extending from September to June; usually equated to
   two semesters, two trimesters, three quarters, or the period covered by a four-one-four plan.
   Room and board is defined as double occupancy and 19 meals per week or the maximum
   meal plan. Required fees include only charges that all full-time students must pay that are
   not included in tuition (e.g., registration, health, or activity fees.) Do not include optional
   fees (e.g., parking, laboratory use).

I1 Please report number of instructional faculty members in each category for Fall 2002.
   The following definition of instructional faculty is used by the American Association of
   University Professors (AAUP) in its annual Faculty Compensation Survey. Instructional
   Faculty is defined as those members of the instructional-research staff whose major regular
   assignment is instruction, including those with released time for research. Institutions are
   asked to EXCLUDE:
   (a) instructional faculty in preclinical and clinical medicine
   (b) administrative officers with titles such as dean of students, librarian, registrar, coach, and
   the like, even though they may devote part of their time to classroom instruction and may
   have faculty status,
   (c) undergraduate or graduate students who assist in the instruction of courses, but have
   titles such as teaching assistant, teaching fellow, and the like
   (d) faculty on leave without pay, and
   (e) replacement faculty for faculty on sabbatical leave.

   Full-time: faculty employed on a full-time basis
   Part-time: faculty teaching less than two semesters, three quarters, two trimesters, or two
   four-month sessions. Also includes adjuncts and part-time instructors.
   Minority faculty: includes faculty who designate themselves as black, non-Hispanic;
   American Indian or Alaskan native; Asian or Pacific Islander; or Hispanic.
   Doctorate: includes such degrees as Doctor of Education, Doctor of Juridical Science,
   Doctor of Public Health, and Doctor of Philosophy degree in any field such as agronomy,
   food technology, education, engineering, public administration, ophthalmology, or
   radiology.
   First-professional: includes the fields of dentistry (DDS or DMD), medicine (MD),
   optometry (OD), osteopathic medicine (DO), pharmacy (DPharm or BPharm), podiatric
   medicine (DPM), veterinary medicine (DVM), chiropractic (DC or DCM), law (JD) and
   theological professions (MDiv, MHL).
   Terminal degree: the highest degree in a field: example, M. Arch (architecture) and MFA
   (master of fine arts).

                                                               Full-Time Part-Time          Total

                i must sum up to item a.)

I2 Student to Faculty Ratio
   Report the Fall 2002 ratio of full-time equivalent students (full-time plus 1/3 part time) to
   full-time equivalent instructional faculty (full time plus 1/3 part time). In the ratio
   calculations, exclude both faculty and students in stand-alone graduate or professional
   programs such as medicine, law, veterinary, dentistry, social work, business, or public health
   in which faculty teach virtually only graduate level students. Do not count undergraduate or
   graduate student teaching assistants as faculty.

  Fall 2002 Student to Faculty ratio                                                    18 to 1

I3 Undergraduate Class Size
   In the table below, please use the following definitions to report information about the size
   of classes and class sections offered in the Fall 2002 term.
   Class Sections: A class section is an organized course offered for credit, identified by
   discipline and number, meeting at a stated time or times in a classroom or similar setting,
   and not a subsection such as a laboratory or discussion session. Undergraduate class sections
   are defined as any sections in which at least one degree-seeking undergraduate student is
   enrolled for credit. Exclude distance learning classes and noncredit classes and individual
   instruction such as dissertation or thesis research, music instruction, or one-to-one readings.
   Exclude students in independent study, co-operative programs, internships, foreign language
   taped tutor sessions, practicums, and all students in one-on-one classes. Each class section
   should be counted only once and should not be duplicated because of course catalog cross-
   listings.
   Class Subsections: A class subsection includes any subsection of a course, such as
   laboratory, recitation, and discussion subsections that are supplementary in nature and are
   scheduled to meet separately from the lecture portion of the course. Undergraduate
   subsections are defined as any subsections of courses in which degree-seeking
   undergraduate students enrolled for credit. As above, exclude noncredit classes and
   individual instruction such as dissertation or thesis research, music instruction, or one-to-one
   readings. Each class subsection should be counted only once and should not be duplicated
   because of cross-listings.
   Using the above definitions, please report for each of the following class-size intervals the
   number of class sections and class subsections offered in Fall 2002. For example, a lecture
   class with 800 students who met at another time in 40 separate labs with 20 students should
   be counted once in the “100+” column in the class section column and 40 times under the
   “20-29” column of the class subsections table.

                                  Financial Aid Definitions


Financial aid applicant: Any applicant who submits any one of the institutionally required
financial aid applications/forms, such as the FAFSA.
Indebtedness: Aggregate dollar amount borrowed through any loan programs (federal, state,
subsidized, unsubsidized, private, etc.; excluding parent loans) while the student was
enrolled at an institution. Student loans co-signed by a parent are assumed to be the
responsibility of the student and should be included.
Institutional and external funds: Endowment, alumni, or external monies for which the
institution determines the recipient or the dollar amount awarded.
Financial need: As determined by your institution using the federal methodology and/or
your institution's own standards.
Need-based aid: College-funded or college-administered award from institutional, state,
federal, or other sources for which a student must have financial need to qualify. This
includes both institutional and noninstitutional student aid (grants, jobs, and loans).
Need-based gift aid: Scholarships and grants from institutional, state, federal, or other
sources for which a student must have financial need to qualify.
Need-based self-help aid: Loans and jobs from institutional, state, federal, or other sources
for which a student must demonstrate financial need to qualify.
Non-need-based gift aid: Scholarships and grants, gifts, or merit-based aid from
institutional, state, federal, or other sources (including unrestricted funds or gifts and
endowment income) awarded solely on the basis of academic achievement, merit, or any
other non-need-based reason. When reporting questions H1 and H2, non-need-based aid that
is used to meet need should be counted as need-based aid.
Note: Suggested order of precedence for counting non-need money as need-based:
Non-need institutional grants
Non-need tuition waivers
Non-need athletic awards
Non-need federal grants
Non-need state grants
Non-need outside grants
Non-need student loans
Non-need parent loans
Non-need work

Non-need-based self-help aid: Loans and jobs from institutional, state, or other sources for

which a student need not demonstrate financial need to qualify.
Scholarships/grants from external sources: Monies received from outside (private)
sources that the student brings with them (e.g., Kiwanis, National Merit scholarships). The
institution may process paperwork to receive the dollars, but it has no role in determining the
recipient or the dollar amount awarded.
Work study and employment: Federal and state work study aid, and any employment
packaged by your institution in financial aid awards.
