Provide 2003-2004 academic year costs of attendance for the following categories that are applicable to
your institution.
This depends upon when the states budget us finalized – probably late summer

G1. Undergraduate full-time tuition, required fees, room and board
    List the typical tuition, required fees, and room and board for a full-time undergraduate student for the FULL
    2003-2004 academic year (30 semester hours or 45 quarter hours for institutions that derive annual tuition by
    multiplying credit hour cost by number of credits). A full academic year refers to the period of time generally
    extending from September to June; usually equated to two semesters, two trimesters, three quarters, or the
    period covered by a four-one-four plan. Room and board is defined as double occupancy and 19 meals per
    week or the maximum meal plan. Required fees include only charges that all full-time students must pay that
    are not included in tuition (e.g., registration, health, or activity fees.) Do not include optional fees (e.g.,
    parking, laboratory use).

                                           H. 2002-03 FINANCIAL AID

Please refer to the following financial aid definitions when completing Section H.

Awarded aid: The dollar amounts offered to financial aid applicants.

Financial aid applicant: Any applicant who submits any one of the institutionally required financial aid
applications/forms, such as the FAFSA.

Indebtedness: Aggregate dollar amount borrowed through any loan program (federal, state, subsidized,
unsubsidized, private, etc.; excluding parent loans) while the student was enrolled at an institution. Student loans
co-signed by a parent are assumed to be the responsibility of the student and should be included.

Institutional scholarships and grants: Endowed scholarships, annual gifts and tuition funded grants for which
the institution determines the recipient.

Financial need: As determined by your institution using the federal methodology and/or your institution's own
standards.

Need-based aid: College-funded or college-administered award from institutional, state, federal, or other sources
for which a student must have financial need to qualify. This includes both institutional and noninstitutional
student aid (grants, jobs, and loans).

Need-based scholarship or grant aid: Scholarships and grants from institutional, state, federal, or other
sources for which a student must have financial need to qualify.

Need-based self-help aid: Loans and jobs from institutional, state, federal, or other sources for which a student
must demonstrate financial need to qualify.

Non-need-based scholarship or grant aid: Scholarships and grants, gifts, or merit-based aid from institutional,
state, federal, or other sources (including unrestricted funds or gifts and endowment income) awarded solely on
the basis of academic achievement, merit, or any other non-need-based reason. When reporting questions H1
and H2, non-need-based aid that is used to meet need should be counted as need-based aid.

     Note: Suggested order of precedence for counting non-need money as need-based:
     Non-need institutional grants
     Non-need tuition waivers
     Non-need athletic awards
     Non-need federal grants
     Non-need state grants
     Non-need outside grants
     Non-need student loans
     Non-need parent loans
     Non-need work

Non-need-based self-help aid: Loans and jobs from institutional, state, or other sources for which a student
need not demonstrate financial need to qualify.

External scholarships and grants: Scholarships and grants received from outside (private) sources that
students bring with them (e.g., Kiwanis, National Merit scholarships). The institution may process paperwork to
receive the dollars, but it has no role in determining the recipient or the dollar amount awarded.

Work study and employment: Federal and state work study aid, and any employment packaged by your
institution in financial aid awards.

Aid Awarded to Enrolled Undergraduates

H1. Enter total dollar amounts awarded to enrolled full-time and less than full-time degree-seeking
   undergraduates (using the same cohort reported in CDS Question B1, “total degree-seeking”
   undergraduates) in the following categories. (Note: If the data being reported are final figures for the 2001-
   2002 academic year (see the next item below), use the 2001-2002 academic year's CDS Question B1
   cohort.) Include aid awarded to international students (i.e., those not qualifying for federal aid). Aid that is
   non-need-based but that was used to meet need should be reported in the need-based aid column.
   (For a suggested order of precedence in assigning categories of aid to cover need, see the entry for
   “non-need-based scholarship or grant aid” on the last page of the definitions section.)

     Indicate the academic year for which data are reported for items H1, H2, H2A, and H6 below:

I-2. Student to Faculty Ratio

Report the fall 2002 ratio of full-time equivalent students (full-time plus 1/3 part time) to full-time equivalent
instructional faculty (full time plus 1/3 part time). In the ratio calculations, exclude both faculty and students in
stand-alone graduate or professional programs such as medicine, law, veterinary, dentistry, social work,
business, or public health in which faculty teach virtually only graduate level students. Do not count
undergraduate or graduate student teaching assistants as faculty.

Fall 2002 Student to Faculty ratio: 22 to 1 (based on 23,123 students and 1,035 faculty).

I-3. Undergraduate Class Size
In the table below, please use the following definitions to report information about the size of classes and class
sections offered in the fall 2002 term.

Class Sections: A class section is an organized course offered for credit, identified by discipline and number,
meeting at a stated time or times in a classroom or similar setting, and not a subsection such as a laboratory or
discussion session. Undergraduate class sections are defined as any sections in which at least one degree-
seeking undergraduate student is enrolled for credit. Exclude distance learning classes and noncredit classes
and individual instruction such as dissertation or thesis research, music instruction, or one-to-one readings.
Exclude students in independent study, co-operative programs, internships, foreign language taped tutor
sessions, practicums, and all students in one-on-one classes. Each class section should be counted only once
and should not be duplicated because of course catalog cross-listings.

Class Subsections: A class subsection includes any subsection of a course, such as laboratory, recitation, and
discussion subsections that are supplementary in nature and are scheduled to meet separately from the lecture
portion of the course. Undergraduate subsections are defined as any subsections of courses in which degree-
seeking undergraduate students enrolled for credit. As above, exclude noncredit classes and individual
instruction such as dissertation or thesis research, music instruction, or one-to-one readings. Each class
subsection should be counted only once and should not be duplicated because of cross-listings.

Using the above definitions, please report for each of the following class-size intervals the number of class
sections and class subsections offered in fall 2002. For example, a lecture class with 800 students who met at
another time in 40 separate labs with 20 students should be counted once in the “100+” column in the class
section column and 40 times under the “20-29” column of the class subsections table.

                            J. 2002-03 Disciplinary areas of DEGREES CONFERRED

Degrees conferred between July 1, 2001 and June 30, 2002

For each of the following discipline areas, provide the percentage of diplomas/certificates, associate, and
bachelor’s degrees awarded. To determine the percentage, use majors, not headcount (e.g., students with one
degree but a double major will be represented twice). Calculate the percentage from your institution’s IPEDS
Completions by using the sum of 1st and 2nd majors for each CIP code as the numerator and the sum of the
Grand Total by 1st Majors and the Grand Total by 2nd major as the denominator. If you prefer, you can compute
the percentages using 1st majors only.

♦    All definitions related to the financial aid section appear at the end of the Definitions document.

♦    Items preceded by an asterisk (*) represent definitions agreed to among publishers which do not appear on
     the CDS document but may be present on individual publishers’ surveys.

*Academic advisement: Plan under which each student is assigned to a faculty member or a trained adviser,
who, through regular meetings, helps the student plan and implement immediate and long-term academic and
vocational goals.
Accelerated program: Completion of a college program of study in fewer than the usual number of years, most
often by attending summer sessions and carrying extra courses during the regular academic term.
Admitted student: Applicant who is offered admission to a degree-granting program at your institution.

*Adult student services: Admission assistance, support, orientation, and other services expressly for adults who
have started college for the first time, or who are re-entering after a lapse of a few years.
American Indian or Alaska native: A person having origins in any of the original peoples of North America and
who maintains cultural identification through tribal affiliation or community recognition.

Applicant (first-time, first year): An individual who has fulfilled the institution’s requirements to be considered
for admission (including payment or waiving of the application fee, if any) and who has been notified of one of the
following actions: admission, nonadmission, placement on waiting list, or application withdrawn (by applicant or
institution).

Application fee: That amount of money that an institution charges for processing a student’s application for
acceptance. This amount is not creditable toward tuition and required fees, nor is it refundable if the student is not
admitted to the institution.

Asian or Pacific Islander: A person having origins in any of the original peoples of the Far East, Southeast Asia,
the Indian Subcontinent, or Pacific Islands. This includes people from China, Japan, Korea, the Philippine
Islands, American Samoa, India, and Vietnam.

Associate degree: An award that normally requires at least two but less than four years of full-time equivalent
college work.

Bachelor’s degree: An award (baccalaureate or equivalent degree, as determined by the Secretary of the U.S.
Department of Education) that normally requires at least four years but not more than five years of full-time
equivalent college-level work. This includes ALL bachelor’s degrees conferred in a five-year cooperative (work-
study plan) program. (A cooperative plan provides for alternate class attendance and employment in business,
industry, or government; thus, it allows students to combine actual work experience with their college studies.)
Also, it includes bachelor’s degrees in which the normal four years of work are completed in three years.

Black, non-Hispanic: A person having origins in any of the black racial groups of Africa (except those of
Hispanic origin).

Board (charges): Assume average cost for 19 meals per week or the maximum meal plan.

Books and supplies (costs): Average cost of books and supplies. Do not include unusual costs for special
groups of students (e.g., engineering or art majors), unless they constitute the majority of students at your
institution.

Calendar system: The method by which an institution structures most of its courses for the academic year.
*Career and placement services: A range of services, including (often) the following: coordination of visits of
employers to campus; aptitude and vocational testing; interest inventories, personal counseling; help in resume
writing, interviewing, launching the job search; listings for those students desiring employment and those seeking
permanent positions; establishment of a permanent reference folder; career resource materials.

school might allow students to enroll and begin studies at various times, with no requirement that classes begin
on a certain date.

Cooperative (work-study plan) program: A program that provides for alternate class attendance and
employment in business, industry, or government.

Cooperative housing: College-owned, -operated, or -affiliated housing in which students share room and board
