     B4-B21: Graduation Rates
     The items in this section correspond to data elements collected by the IPEDS Web-based Data Collection Systemʼs
     Graduation Rate Survey (GRS).

     • For complete instructions and definitions of data elements, see the IPEDS GRS Forms and Instructions
       for the 2021-2022 Survey. https://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/use-the-data/survey-components/9/graduation-rates

     In the following section for bachelorʼs or equivalent programs, please disaggregate the Fall 2014 and Fall
     2015 cohorts (formerly CDS B4-B11) into four groups:
     • Students who received a Federal Pell Grant*
     • Recipients of a subsidized Staﬀord Loan who did not receive a Pell Grant
     • Students who did not receive either a Pell Grant or a subsidized Staﬀord Loan
     • Total (all students, regardless of Pell Grant or subsidized loan status)

     *Students who received both a Federal Pell Grant and a subsidized Staﬀord Loan should be reported in the
     "Recipients of a Federal Pell Grant" column.

     For each graduation rate grid below, the numbers in the first three columns for Questions A-G should sum to
     the cohort total in the fourth column (formerly CDS B4-B11).

G1 Undergraduate full-time tuition, required fees, room and board
   List the typical tuition, required fees, and room and board for a full-time undergraduate student for the FULL
   2022-2023 academic year. (30 semester hours or 45 quarter hours for institutions that derive annual tuition
   by multiplying credit hour cost by number of credits).
     • A full academic year refers to the period of time generally extending from September to June; usually
       equated to two semesters, two trimesters, three quarters, or the period covered by a four-one-four plan.
     • Room and board is defined as double occupancy and 19 meals per week or the maximum meal plan.
     • Required fees include only charges that all full-time students must pay that are not included in tuition
       (e.g., registration, health, or activity fees.)


     • Do not include optional fees (e.g., parking, laboratory use).

                                             H. FINANCIAL AID

     Please refer to the following financial aid definitions when completing Section H.

     Awarded aid: The dollar amounts oﬀered to financial aid applicants.

     Financial aid applicant: Any applicant who submits any one of the institutionally required financial aid
     applications/forms, such as the FAFSA.

     Indebtedness: Aggregate dollar amount borrowed through any loan program (federal, state, subsidized,
     unsubsidized, private, etc.; excluding parent loans) while the student was enrolled at an institution. Student
     loans co-signed by a parent are assumed to be the responsibility of the student and should be included.


     Institutional scholarships and grants: Endowed scholarships, annual gi s and tuition funded grants for
     which the institution determines the recipient.
     Financial need: As determined by your institution using the federal methodology and/or your institution's
     own standards.
     Need-based aid: College-funded or college-administered award from institutional, state, federal, or other
     sources for which a student must have financial need to qualify. This includes both institutional and
     non-institutional student aid (grants, jobs, and loans).

     Need-based scholarship or grant aid: Scholarships and grants from institutional, state, federal, or other
     sources for which a student must have financial need to qualify.
     Need-based self-help aid: Loans and jobs from institutional, state, federal, or other sources for which a
     student must demonstrate financial need to qualify.
     Non-need-based scholarship or grant aid: Scholarships and grants, gi s, or merit-based aid from
     institutional, state, federal, or other sources (including unrestricted funds or gi s and endowment income)
     awarded solely on the basis of academic achievement, merit, or any other non-need-based reason. When
     reporting questions H1 and H2, non-need-based aid that is used to meet need should be counted as
     need-based aid.
     Note: Suggested order of precedence for counting non-need money as need-based:
       1. Non-need institutional grants                 6. Non-need outside grants
       2. Non-need tuition waivers                      7. Non-need student loans
       3. Non-need athletic awards                      8. Non-need parent loans
       4. Non-need federal grants                       9. Non-need work
       5. Non-need state grants
     Non-need-based self-help aid: Loans and jobs from institutional, state, or other sources for which a student
     need not demonstrate financial need to qualify.
     Private student loans: A nonfederal loan made by a lender such as a bank, credit union or private lender
     used to pay for up to the annual cost of education, less any financial aid received.

     External scholarships and grants: Scholarships and grants received from outside (private) sources that
     students bring with them (e.g., Kiwanis, National Merit scholarships). The institution may process paperwork
     to receive the dollars, but it has no role in determining the recipient or the dollar amount awarded.
     Work study and employment: Federal and state work study aid, and any employment packaged by your
     institution in financial aid awards.




     Aid Awarded to Enrolled Undergraduates

H1   Enter total dollar amounts awarded to enrolled full-time and less than full-time degree-seeking
     undergraduates (using the same cohort reported in CDS Question B1, “total degree-seeking”
     undergraduates) in the following categories.
     • If the data being reported are final figures for the 2020-2021 academic year (see the next item below),
       use the 2020-2021 academic year's CDS Question B1 cohort.
     • Include aid awarded to international students (i.e., those not qualifying for federal aid).
     • Aid that is non-need-based but that was used to meet need should be reported in the need-based aid
       column.
     • For a suggested order of precedence in assigning categories of aid to cover need, see the entry for “non-
       need-based scholarship or grant aid” on the last page of the definitions section.

H5. Number and percent of students in class (defined in H4 above) borrowing from federal, non-federal, and
any loan sources, and the average (or mean) amount borrowed.
        • The “Average per-undergraduate-borrower cumulative principal borrowed,” is designed to provide
        better information about student borrowing from federal and nonfederal (institutional, state,
        commercial) sources.
        • The numbers, percentages, and averages for each row should be based only on the loan source
        specified for the particular row. For example, the federal loans average (row b) should only be the
        cumulative average of federal loans and the private loans average (row e) should only be the cumulative
        average of private loans.

I-2. Student to Faculty Ratio
    Report the Fall 2021 ratio of full-time equivalent students (full-time plus 1/3 part time) to full-time
    equivalent instructional faculty (full time plus 1/3 part time). In the ratio calculations, exclude both faculty
    and students in stand-alone graduate or professional programs such as medicine, law, veterinary, dentistry,
    social work, business, or public health in which faculty teach virtually only graduate level students.
    • Do not count undergraduate or graduate student teaching assistants as faculty.

    Fall 2021 Student to Faculty ratio                         5         to 1     (based on      7,645    students
                                                                                           and   1,411    faculty).
I-3. Undergraduate Class Size
    In the table below, please use the following definitions to report information about the size of classes and
    class sections oﬀered in the Fall 2021 term.
    Class Sections: A class section is an organized course oﬀered for credit, identified by discipline and number,
    meeting at a stated time or times in a classroom or similar setting, and not a subsection such as a laboratory
    or discussion session. Undergraduate class sections are defined as any sections in which at least one
    degree-seeking undergraduate student is enrolled for credit. Exclude distance learning classes and
    noncredit classes and individual instruction such as dissertation or thesis research, music instruction, or
    one-to-one readings. Exclude students in independent study, co-operative programs, internships, foreign
    language taped tutor sessions, practicums, and all students in one-on-one classes. Each class section
    should be counted only once and should not be duplicated because of course catalog cross-listings.

    Class Subsections: A class subsection includes any subsection of a course, such as laboratory, recitation,
    and discussion subsections that are supplementary in nature and are scheduled to meet separately from
    the lecture portion of the course. Undergraduate subsections are defined as any subsections of courses in
    which degree-seeking undergraduate students enrolled for credit. As above, exclude noncredit classes and
    individual instruction such as dissertation or thesis research, music instruction, or one-to-one readings.
    Each class subsection should be counted only once and should not be duplicated because of cross-listings.


    Using the above definitions, please report for each of the following class-size intervals the number of class
    sections and class subsections oﬀered in Fall 2021. For example, a lecture class with 800 students who met at
    another time in 40 separate labs with 20 students should be counted once in the “100+” column in the class
    section column and 40 times under the “20-29” column of the class subsections table.

                                          J. Disciplinary areas of DEGREES CONFERRED

J1 Degrees conferred between July 1, 2020 and June 30, 2021
    For each of the following discipline areas, provide the percentage of diplomas/certificates, associate, and bachelorʼs degrees awarded. To
    determine the percentage, use majors, not headcount (e.g., students with one degree but a double major will be represented twice). Calculate
    the percentage from your institutionʼs IPEDS Completions by using the sum of 1st and 2nd majors for each CIP code as the numerator and the
    sum of the Grand Total by 1st Majors and the Grand Total by 2nd major as the denominator. If you prefer, you can compute the percentages
    using 1st majors only.
