Common Data Set 2010-2011
The Common Data Set Initiative is a collaborative effort between publishers and the
educational community to improve the quality and accuracy of information provided to all
involved in a student's transition into higher education, as well as to reduce the burden on
colleges of compiling and reporting information. Questions and definitions used by the U.S.
Department of Education in its college surveys are a guide in the development of CDS
items. Common Data Set items undergo broad review by secondary schools and two-and
four-year colleges.

H15. If you institution has recently implemented any major financial aid policy, program or
initiative to make your institution more affordable to incoming students, such as replacing
loans with grants, or waiving costs for families below a certain income, please provide
details below:
"Zero Parent Contribution for Parents with Income Below $60,000
For parents with total annual income below $60,000 and typical assets for this income
range, Stanford will not expect a parent contribution toward educational costs. Students will
still be expected to contribute toward their own expenses from their summer income, part-
time work during the school year, and their own savings.
Tuition Charges Covered for Parents with Income Below $100,000
For parents with total annual income below $100,000 and typical assets for this income
range, the expected parent contribution will be low enough to ensure that all tuition charges
are covered with need-based scholarship, federal and state grants, and/or outside
scholarship funds.
Families with incomes at higher levels (typically up to $200,000) may also qualify for
assistance, especially if more than one family member is enrolled in college. We encourage
any family concerned about the ability to pay for a Stanford education to complete the
application process. If we are not able to offer need-based scholarship funds we will
recommend available loan programs.

I. INSTRUCTIONAL FACULTY AND CLASS SIZE
I-1. Please report number of instructional faculty members in each category for Fall 2010.
The following definition of instructional faculty is used by the American Association of
University Professors (AAUP) in its annual Faculty Compensation Survey. Instructional
Faculty is defined as those members of the instructional-research staff whose major regular

assignment is instruction, including those with released time for research. Institutions are
asked to EXCLUDE:
(a) instructional faculty in preclinical and clinical medicine
(b) administrative officers with titles such as dean of students, librarian, registrar, coach,
and the like, even though they may devote part of their time to classroom instruction and
may have faculty status,
(c) undergraduate or graduate students who assist in the instruction of courses, but have
titles such as teaching assistant, teaching fellow, and the like
(d) faculty on leave without pay, and
(e) replacement faculty for faculty on sabbatical leave.
Full-time: faculty employed on a full-time basis
Part-time: faculty teaching less than two semesters, three quarters, two trimesters, or two
four-month sessions. Also includes adjuncts and part-time instructors.
Minority faculty: includes faculty who designate themselves as black, non-Hispanic;
American Indian or Alaskan native; Asian, Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander; or Hispanic.
Doctorate: includes such degrees as Doctor of Philosophy, Doctor of Education, Doctor of
Juridical Science and Doctor of Public Health in any field such as arts, sciences, education,
business and public administration. Also includes terminal degrees formerly designated as
"first professional," including dentistry, medicine, optometry, osteopathic medicine,
pharmacy, podiatric medicine, veterinary medicine, chiropractic or law.
Terminal degree: the highest degree in a field: example, M. Arch (architecture) and MFA
(master of fine arts).

I-2. Student to Faculty Ratio
Report the Fall 2010 ratio of full-time equivalent students (full-time plus 1/3 part time) to full-
time equivalent instructional faculty (full time plus 1/3 part time). In the ratio calculations,
exclude both faculty and students in stand-alone graduate or professional programs such as
medicine, law, veterinary, dentistry, social work, business, or public health in which faculty
teach virtually only graduate level students. Do not count undergraduate or graduate
student teaching assistants as faculty.
Fall 2010 Student to Faculty ratio: 6 to 1 (based on 6,887 students and 1,109 faculty*)
* Faculty count includes the ranks of professor, associate professor, assistant professor
(including parenthetical teaching faculty), instructors, senior lecturers and lecturers.
Lecturers, senior lecturers and instructors are counted on an FTE basis.


I-3. Undergraduate Class Size
In the table below, please use the following definitions to report information about the size of
classes and class sections offered in the Fall 2010 term.


Class Sections: A class section is an organized course offered for credit, identified by
discipline and number, meeting at a stated time or times in a classroom or similar setting,
and not a subsection such as a laboratory or discussion session. Undergraduate class
sections are defined as any sections in which at least one degree-seeking undergraduate
student is enrolled for credit. Exclude distance learning classes and noncredit classes and
individual instruction such as dissertation or thesis research, music instruction, or one-to-
one readings. Exclude students in independent study, co-operative programs, internships,
foreign language taped tutor sessions, practicums, and all students in one-on-one classes.
Each class section should be counted only once and should not be duplicated because of
course catalog cross-listings.


Class Subsections: A class subsection includes any subsection of a course, such as
laboratory, recitation, and discussion subsections that are supplementary in nature and are
scheduled to meet separately from the lecture portion of the course. Undergraduate
subsections are defined as any subsections of courses in which degree-seeking
undergraduate students enrolled for credit. As above, exclude noncredit classes and
individual instruction such as dissertation or thesis research, music instruction, or one-to-
one readings. Each class subsection should be counted only once and should not be
duplicated because of cross-listings.
