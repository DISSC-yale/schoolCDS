Stanford University
Common Data Set 2011-2012
The Common Data Set (CDS) initiative is a collaborative effort among data providers in the
higher education community and publishers as represented by the College Board,
Peterson's, and U.S. News & World Report. The combined goal of this collaboration is to
improve the quality and accuracy of information provided to all involved in a student's
transition into higher education, as well as to reduce the reporting burden on data providers.
This goal is attained by the development of clear, standard data items and definitions in
order to determine a specific cohort relevant to each item. Data items and definitions used
by the U.S. Department of Education in its higher education surveys often serve as a guide
in the continued development of the CDS. Common Data Set items undergo broad review
by the CDS Advisory Board as well as by data providers representing secondary schools
and two- and four-year colleges.

H14. Athletic aid is the only non-need based institutional aid awarded at Stanford.
H15. If you institution has recently implemented any major financial aid policy, program or
initiative to make your institution more affordable to incoming students, such as replacing
loans with grants, or waiving costs for families below a certain income, please provide
details below:
"Zero Parent Contribution for Parents with Income Below $60,000
For parents with total annual income below $60,000 and typical assets for this income
range, Stanford will not expect a parent contribution toward educational costs. Students will
still be expected to contribute toward their own expenses from their summer income, part-
time work during the school year, and their own savings.
Tuition Charges Covered for Parents with Income Below $100,000
For parents with total annual income below $100,000 and typical assets for this income
range, the expected parent contribution will be low enough to ensure that all tuition charges
are covered with need-based scholarship, federal and state grants, and/or outside
scholarship funds.
Families with incomes at higher levels (typically up to $200,000) may also qualify for
assistance, especially if more than one family member is enrolled in college. We encourage
any family concerned about the ability to pay for a Stanford education to complete the
application process. If we are not able to offer need-based scholarship funds we will
recommend available loan programs.

I. INSTRUCTIONAL FACULTY AND CLASS SIZE
I-1. Report number of instructional faculty members in each category for Fall 2011. Include
faculty who are on your institution's payroll on the census date your institution uses for
IPEDS/AAUP.
The following definition of instructional faculty is used by the American Association of
University Professors (AAUP) in its annual Faculty Compensation Survey (the part-time

definitions are not used by AAUP). Instructional Faculty is defined as those members of the
instructional-research staff whose major regular assignment is instruction, including those
with released time for research. Use the directions below to determine inclusions and
exclusions:
(a) exclude full-time instructional faculty in preclinical and clinical medicine, faculty who are
not paid or research-only faculty, post-doctoral fellows or pre-doctoral fellows; include part-
time only if they teach one or more non-clinical credit courses
(b) exclude administrative officers with titles such as dean of students, librarian, registrar,
coach and the like, even though they may devote part of their time to classroom instruction
and may have faculty status; include part time if they teach one or more non-clinical credit
courses
(c) exclude other administrators/staff who teach one or more non-clinical credit courses
even though they do not have faculty status; include if they are part time
(d) exclude undergraduate or graduate students who assist in the instruction of courses, but
have titles such as teaching assistant, teaching fellow and the like; exclude if they are part
time
(e) include full-time faculty on sabbatical or leave with pay; exclude them if they are part
time
(f) exclude full-time faculty on leave without pay; also exclude part-time faculty on leave
without pay
(g) exclude full-time replacement faculty for faculty on sabbatical leave or leave with pay;
include if they are part time
Full-time instructional faculty: faculty employed on a full-time basis for instruction, including
those with released time for research
Part-time instructional faculty: Adjuncts and other instructors being paid solely for part-time
classroom instruction. Also
includes full-time faculty teaching less than two semesters, three quarters, two trimesters or
two four-month sessions.
Employees who are not considered full-time instruction faculty but who teach one or more
non-clinical credit courses may
be counted as part-time faculty.
Minority faculty: includes faculty who designate themselves as black, non-Hispanic;
American Indian or Alaskan native; Asian, Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander; or Hispanic.
Doctorate: includes such degrees as Doctor of Philosophy, Doctor of Education, Doctor of
Juridical Science, and Doctor of
Public Health in any field such as arts, sciences, education, engineering, business, and
public administration. Also includes
terminal degrees formerly designated as “first professional,” including dentistry (DDS or
DMD), medicine (MD), optometry
(OD), osteopathic medicine (DO), pharmacy (DPharm or BPharm), podiatric medicine
(DPM), veterinary medicine (DVM),
chiropractic (DC or DCM) or law (JD).
Terminal master's degree:a master’s degree that is considered the highest degree in a field:
example, M. Arch (in

architecture) and MFA (master of fine arts in art or theater).

I-2. Student to Faculty Ratio
Report the Fall 2011 ratio of full-time equivalent students (full-time plus 1/3 part time) to full-
time equivalent instructional faculty (full time plus 1/3 part time). In the ratio calculations,
exclude both faculty and students in stand-alone graduate or professional programs such as
medicine, law, veterinary, dentistry, social work, business, or public health in which faculty
teach virtually only graduate level students. Do not count undergraduate or graduate
student teaching assistants as faculty.
Fall 2011 Student to Faculty ratio: 5 to 1 (based on 6,927 students and 1,463 faculty*)


Please Note:
* Stanford faculty count includes the ranks of professor, associate professor, assistant
professor (including parenthetical teaching and performance faculty), instructors, senior
lecturers and lecturers. Faculty in graduate schools (business, education, law, medicine)
are included if they taught undergraduates during 2011. Lecturers, senior lecturers and
instructors are counted on an FTE basis.
* Stanford total faculty includes all tenure-line and parenthetical teaching and performance
faculty, as well as those Medical Center Line faculty who taught undergraduates during
2011.

* Stanford stand-alone graduate faculty includes faculty in graduate schools (business,
education, law, medicine) who did not teach undergraduates during 2011.



I-3. Undergraduate Class Size
In the table below, please use the following definitions to report information about the size of
classes and class sections offered in the Fall 2011 term.


Class Sections: A class section is an organized course offered for credit, identified by
discipline and number, meeting at a stated time or times in a classroom or similar setting,
and not a subsection such as a laboratory or discussion session. Undergraduate class
sections are defined as any sections in which at least one degree-seeking undergraduate
student is enrolled for credit. Exclude distance learning classes and noncredit classes and
individual instruction such as dissertation or thesis research, music instruction, or one-to-
one readings. Exclude students in independent study, co-operative programs, internships,
foreign language taped tutor sessions, practicums, and all students in one-on-one classes.
Each class section should be counted only once and should not be duplicated because of
course catalog cross-listings.


Class Subsections: A class subsection includes any subsection of a course, such as
laboratory, recitation, and discussion subsections that are supplementary in nature and are
scheduled to meet separately from the lecture portion of the course. Undergraduate
subsections are defined as any subsections of courses in which degree-seeking
undergraduate students enrolled for credit. As above, exclude noncredit classes and
individual instruction such as dissertation or thesis research, music instruction, or one-to-
one readings. Each class subsection should be counted only once and should not be
duplicated because of cross-listings.
