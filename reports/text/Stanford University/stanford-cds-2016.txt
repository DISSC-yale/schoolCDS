D16. Minimum number of credits that transfers must complete at your institution to earn a bachelor’s degree: 90

D17. Describe other transfer credit policies: Credit from another institution will be transferred for courses that are
substantially equivalent to those offered at Stanford University on the undergraduate level, subject to the approval
of the credit evaluator. A maximum of 20 quarter units may represent courses that do not parallel specific courses at
Stanford, again, subject to the approval of the credit evaluator as to quality and suitability.

Credit earned in extension and correspondence courses is transferable only if the university offering the courses
allows that credit toward its own bachelor's degree. Such credit is limited to a maximum of 45 quarter units for
extension courses, a maximum of 15 quarter units for correspondence study, and a maximum of 45 quarter units for
the combination of extension and correspondence courses.

G1. Undergraduate full-time tuition, required fees, room and board.
List the typical tuition, required fees, and room and board for a full-time undergraduate student for the FULL 2016-
2017 academic year (30 semester or 45 quarter hours for institutions that derive annual tuition by multiplying credit
hour cost by number of credits). A full academic year refers to the period of time generally extending from September
to June; usually equated to two semesters, two trimesters, three quarters, or the period covered by a four-one-four
plan. Room and board is defined as double occupancy and 19 meals per week or the maximum meal plan. Required
fees include only charges that all full-time students must pay that are not included in tuition (e.g., registration, health,
or activity fees.) Do not include optional fees (e.g., parking, laboratory use).

H14. Athletic aid is the only non-need based institutional aid awarded at Stanford.

H15. If your institution has recently implemented any major financial aid policy, program, or initiative to make your
institution more affordable to incoming students such as replacing loans with grants, or waiving costs for families
below a certain income level please provide details below:

•      Zero parent contribution: Parents with annual income below $65,000 and assets typical of this income level are
       not expected to contribute towards the cost of tuition, mandatory fees, room, or board.

•      Students from families with annual income below $125,000 and assets typical of this income level are assured of
       at least enough scholarship funds to cover the cost of tuition.

•      Students from families at higher income levels (typically up to $200,000) may also qualify for aid based on a full
       analysis of their financial situation (including family income and assets, household size, cost of living, the number
       of family members in college, or other special circumstances).

Student to Faculty Ratio
I2. Report the Fall 2016 ratio of full-time equivalent students (full-time plus 1/3 part time) to full-time equivalent
instructional faculty (full time plus 1/3 part time). In the ratio calculations, exclude both faculty and students in
stand-alone graduate or professional programs such as medicine, law, veterinary, dentistry, social work, business, or
public health in which faculty teach virtually only graduate-level students. Do not count undergraduate or graduate
student teaching assistants as faculty.

Fall 2016 Student to Faculty ratio: 4.25 to 1, based on 7032 students and 1654 faculty.

I3. Undergraduate Class Size
In the table below, please use the following definitions to report information about the size of classes and class
sections offered in the Fall 2016 term.

Class Sections: A class section is an organized course offered for credit, identified by discipline and number, meeting
at a stated time or times in a classroom or similar setting, and not a subsection such as a laboratory or discussion
session. Undergraduate class sections are defined as any sections in which at least one degree-seeking
undergraduate student is enrolled for credit. Exclude distance learning classes and noncredit classes and individual
instruction such as dissertation or thesis research, music instruction, or one-to-one readings. Exclude students in
independent study, co-operative programs, internships, foreign language taped tutor sessions, practicums, and all
students in one-on-one classes. Each class section should be counted only once and should not be duplicated
because of course catalog cross-listings.

Class Subsections: A class subsection includes any subsection of a course, such as laboratory, recitation, and
discussion subsections that are supplementary in nature and are scheduled to meet separately from the lecture
portion of the course. Undergraduate subsections are defined as any subsections of courses in which degree-seeking
undergraduate students enrolled for credit. As above, exclude noncredit classes and individual instruction such as
dissertation or thesis research, music instruction, or one-to-one readings. Each class subsection should be counted
only once and should not be duplicated because of cross-listings.

J1. Degrees conferred between July 1, 2015 and June 30, 2016
For each of the following discipline areas, provide the percentage of diplomas/certificates, associate, and bacelor’s
degrees awarded. To determine the percentage, use majors, not headcount (e.g., students with one degree but a
double major will be represented twice). Calculate the percentage from your institution’s IPEDS Completions by
using the sum of 1st and 2nd majors for each CIP code as the numerator and the sum of the Grand Total by 1st
Majors and the Grand Total by 2nd major as the denominator. If you prefer, you can compute the percentages using
1st majors only.
