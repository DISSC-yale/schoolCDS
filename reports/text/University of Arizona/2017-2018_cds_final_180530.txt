       The items in this section correspond to data elements collected by the IPEDS Web-based Data Collection
       System’s Graduation Rate Survey (GRS). For complete instructions and definitions of data elements, see
       the IPEDS GRS Forms and Instructions for the 2017-18 Survey



       For Bachelor's or Equivalent Institutions



       In the following section for bachelor’s or equivalent programs, please disaggregate the Fall 2010 and Fall
       2011 cohorts (formerly CDS B4-B11) into four groups:
       • Students who received a Federal Pell Grant*
       • Recipients of a subsidized Stafford Loan who did not receive a Pell Grant
       • Students who did not receive either a Pell Grant or a subsidized Stafford Loan
       • Total (all students, regardless of Pell Grant or subsidized loan status)
       *Students who received both a Federal Pell Grant and a subsidized Stafford Loan should be reported in the
       "Recipients of a Federal Pell Grant" column.
       For each graduation rate grid below, the numbers in the first three columns for Questions A-G should sum
       to the cohort total in the fourth column (formerly CDS B4-B11).

G1 Undergraduate full-time tuition, required fees, room and board List the typical tuition, required
   fees, and room and board for a full-time undergraduate student for the FULL 2018-2019 academic
   year (30 semester or 45 quarter hours for institutions that derive annual tuition by multiplying
   credit hour cost by number of credits). A full academic year refers to the period of time generally
   extending from September to June; usually equated to two semesters, two trimesters, three
   quarters, or the period covered by a four-one-four plan. Room and board is defined as double
   occupancy and 19 meals per week or the maximum meal plan. Required fees include only charges
   that all full-time students must pay that are not included in tuition (e.g., registration, health, or
   activity fees.) Do not include optional fees (e.g., parking, laboratory use).

     Aid Awarded to Enrolled Undergraduates
     Enter total dollar amounts awarded to enrolled full-time and less than full-time degree-seeking
     undergraduates (using the same cohort reported in CDS Question B1, “total degree-seeking”
     undergraduates) in the following categories. (Note: If the data being reported are final figures for the 2016-
     2017 academic year (see the next item below), use the 2016-2017 academic year's CDS Question B1
     cohort.) Include aid awarded to international students (i.e., those not qualifying for federal aid). Aid that is
     non-need-based but that was used to meet need should be reported in the need-based aid columns. (For a
     suggested order of precedence in assigning categories of aid to cover need, see the entry for “non-need-
     based scholarship or grant aid” on the last page of the definitions section.)

     faculty who are on your institution’s payroll on the census date your institution uses for

     (AAUP) in its annual Faculty Compensation Survey (the part time definitions are not used by AAUP). Instructional
     Faculty is defined as those members of the instructional-research staff whose major regular assignment is instruction,
     including those with released time for research. Use the chart below to determine inclusions and exclusions:

     Report the Fall 2017 ratio of full-time equivalent students (full-time plus 1/3 part time) to full-time equivalent
     instructional faculty (full time plus 1/3 part time). In the ratio calculations, exclude both faculty and students
     in stand-alone graduate or professional programs such as medicine, law, veterinary, dentistry, social work,
     business, or public health in which faculty teach virtually only graduate-level students. Do not count
     undergraduate or graduate student teaching assistants as faculty.

I3   Undergraduate Class Size
     In the table below, please use the following definitions to report information about the size of classes and
     class sections offered in the Fall 2017 term.
     Class Sections: A class section is an organized course offered for credit, identified by discipline and
     number, meeting at a stated time or times in a classroom or similar setting, and not a subsection such as a
     laboratory or discussion session. Undergraduate class sections are defined as any sections in which at
     least one degree-seeking undergraduate student is enrolled for credit. Exclude distance learning classes
     and noncredit classes and individual instruction such as dissertation or thesis research, music instruction,
     or one-to-one readings. Exclude students in independent study, co-operative programs, internships, foreign
     language taped tutor sessions, practicums, and all students in one-on-one classes. Each class section
     should be counted only once and should not be duplicated because of course catalog cross-listings.

     Class Subsections: A class subsection includes any subsection of a course, such as laboratory,
     recitation, and discussion subsections that are supplementary in nature and are scheduled to meet
     separately from the lecture portion of the course. Undergraduate subsections are defined as any
     subsections of courses in which degree-seeking undergraduate students enrolled for credit. As above,
     exclude noncredit classes and individual instruction such as dissertation or thesis research, music
     instruction, or one-to-one readings. Each class subsection should be counted only once and should not be
     duplicated because of cross-listings.
     Using the above definitions, please report for each of the following class-size intervals the number of class
     sections and class subsections offered in Fall 2017. For example, a lecture class with 800 students who
     met at another time in 40 separate labs with 20 students should be counted once in the “100+” column in
     the class section column and 40 times under the “20-29” column of the class subsections table.

J1   Degrees conferred between July 1, 2016 and June 30, 2017
J1   For each of the following discipline areas, provide the percentage of diplomas/certificates, associate, and bachelor’s degrees awarded. To
     determine the percentage, use majors, not headcount (e.g., students with one degree but a double major will be represented twice).
     Calculate the percentage from your institution’s IPEDS Completions by using the sum of 1st and 2nd majors for each CIP code as the
     numerator and the sum of the Grand Total by 1st Majors and the Grand Total by 2nd major as the denominator. If you prefer, you can
     compute the percentages using 1st majors only.
