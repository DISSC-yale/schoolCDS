Common Data Set 2022-2023


Welcome to the 2022-2023 Common Data Set collection!


The Common Data Set (CDS) initiative is a collaborative effort among data providers in
the higher education community and publishers as represented by the College Board,
Peterson’s, and U.S. News & World Report. The combined goal of this collaboration is
to improve the quality and accuracy of information provided to all involved in a student’s
transition into higher education, as well as to reduce the reporting burden on data
providers.

The CDS is a set of standards and definitions of data items rather than a survey
instrument or set of data represented in a database. Each of the higher education surveys
conducted by the participating publishers incorporates items from the CDS as well as
unique items proprietary to each publisher. Consequently, the publishers’ surveys differ in
that they utilize varying numbers of items from the CDS.

Those who report data for their colleges are urged to abide by the definitions and the
cohorts specified when answering CDS items. They are also urged to use the answers to
CDS items when responding to the numerous survey requests they receive, by
distributing photocopies of their answers, posting them on their websites, or by other
effective means.

Further information about the CDS initiative can be found at https://commondataset.org/.

B2. Enrollment by Racial/Ethnic Category.
Provide numbers of undergraduate students for each of the following categories as of the institution’s official fall
reporting date or as of October 19, 2022.
        Include international students only in the category "Nonresident."
        Complete the “Total Undergraduates” column only if you cannot provide data for the first two columns.
        Report as your institution reports to IPEDS: persons who are Hispanic should be reported only on the
         Hispanic line, not under any race, and persons who are non-Hispanic multi-racial should be reported only
         under "Two or more races."
     New guidance from IPEDS for reporting aggregate data:
    Racial/ethnic destinations are requested only for United States citizens, residents, and other eligible non-citizens.
    Eligible non-citizens include all students who completed high school or a GED equivalency within the United
    States (including DACA and undocumented students) and who were not an F-1 non-immigrant student visa at
    the time of high school graduation.
    More information about other eligible (for financial aid purposes) non-citizens is available at
    https://studentaid.gov/understandaid/eligibility/requirements/non-us-citizens.
    Nonresident – A person who is not a citizen or national of the United States and who is in this country on a
    student visa or temporary basis and does not have the right to remain indefinitely. Do not include DACA,
    undocumented, or other eligible noncitizens in this category.
    NOTE – Nonresidents are to be reported separately, in the boxes provided, rather than included in any of the
    seven racial/ethnic categories or in race/ethnicity unknown.

B4-B21: Graduation Rates
The items in this section correspond to data elements collected by the IPEDS Web-based Data Collection
System’s Graduation Rate Survey (GRS).

            For complete instructions and definitions of data elements, see the IPEDS GRS Forms and Instructions
             for the 2022-2023 Survey. https://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/use-the-data/survey-components/9/graduation-rates

In the following section for bachelor’s or equivalent programs, please disaggregate the Fall 2015 and Fall
2016 cohorts (formerly CDS B4-B11) into four groups:

     •       Students who received a Federal Pell Grant*
     •       Recipients of a subsidized Stafford Loan who did not receive a Pell Grant
     •       Students who did not receive either a Pell Grant or a subsidized Stafford Loan
     •       Total (all students, regardless of Pell Grant or subsidized loan status)
             *     Students who received both a Federal Pell Grant and a subsidized Stafford Loan should be reported
                   in the "Recipients of a Federal Pell Grant" column.

For each graduation rate grid below, the numbers in the first three columns for Questions A-G should sum to the
cohort total in the fourth column (formerly CDS B4-B11).

                                                 For Bachelor’s or Equivalent Programs
Please provide data for the Fall 2016 cohort if available. If Fall 2016 cohort data are not available, provide data

           Applicants should include only those students who fulfilled the requirements for consideration for admission (i.e., who
            completed actionable applications) and who have been notified of one of the following actions: admission, non-
            admission, placement on waiting list, or application withdrawn (by applicant or institution).

           Admitted applicants should include wait-listed students who were subsequently offered admission.

           Since the total may include students who did not provide gender data, the detail need not sum to the total.

         If your institution collects and reports non-binary gender data, please use the “Another Gender” category.
         Note that recent high school graduates and other students without prior postsecondary experience will still be
          considered “first-time students” for fall enrollment reporting purposes even if they enrolled in the summer prior to fall
          enrollment.

C9-C12: First-time, first-year Profile
Provide information for ALL enrolled, degree-seeking, full-time and part-time, first-time, first-year students
enrolled in Fall 2022, including students who began studies during summer, international students/
nonresident, and students admitted under special arrangements.

C9. Percent and number of first-time, first-year students enrolled in Fall 2022 who submitted national
standardized (SAT/ACT) test scores.

      Include information for ALL enrolled, degree-seeking, first-time, first-year students who submitted
       test scores.

      Do not include partial test scores (e.g., mathematics scores but not critical reading for a category of
       students) or combine other standardized test results (such as TOEFL) in this item.

      Do not convert SAT scores to ACT scores and vice versa.

      If a student submitted multiple sets of scores for a single test, report this information according to how you
       use the data. For example:

       •   If you consider the highest scores from either submission, use the highest combination of scores (e.g.,
           verbal from one submission, math from the other).

       •   If you average the scores, use the average to report the scores.


                                                                 Percent       Number

                                                H. FINANCIAL AID

Please refer to the following financial aid definitions when completing Section H.

Awarded aid: The dollar amounts offered to financial aid applicants.

Financial aid applicant: Any applicant who submits any one of the institutionally required financial aid
applications/forms, such as the FAFSA.

Indebtedness: Aggregate dollar amount borrowed through any loan program (federal, state, subsidized,
unsubsidized, private, etc.; excluding parent loans) while the student was enrolled at an institution. Student loans
co-signed by a parent are assumed to be the responsibility of the student and should be included.

Institutional scholarships and grants: Endowed scholarships, annual gifts and tuition funded grants for which the
institution determines the recipient.

Financial need: As determined by your institution using the federal methodology and/or your institution's own
standards.

Need-based aid: College-funded or college-administered award from institutional, state, federal, or other sources
for which a student must have financial need to qualify. This includes both institutional and non-institutional student
aid (grants, jobs, and loans).

Need-based scholarship or grant aid: Scholarships and grants from institutional, state, federal, or other sources
for which a student must have financial need to qualify.

Need-based self-help aid: Loans and jobs from institutional, state, federal, or other sources for which a student
must demonstrate financial need to qualify.

Non-need-based scholarship or grant aid: Scholarships and grants, gifts, or merit-based aid from institutional,
state, federal, or other sources (including unrestricted funds or gifts and endowment income) awarded solely on the
basis of academic achievement, merit, or any other non-need-based reason. When reporting questions H1 and H2,
non-need-based aid that is used to meet need should be counted as need-based aid.

    Note: Suggested order of precedence for counting non-need money as need-based:
              1.   Non-need institutional grants                              6.   Non-need outside grants
              2.   Non-need tuition waivers                                   7.   Non-need student loans
              3.   Non-need athletic awards                                   8.   Non-need parent loans
              4.   Non-need federal grants                                    9.   Non-need work
              5.   Non-need state grants

Non-need-based self-help aid: Loans and jobs from institutional, state, or other sources for which a student need
not demonstrate financial need to qualify.
Private student loans: A nonfederal loan made by a lender such as a bank, credit union or private lender used to
pay for up to the annual cost of education, less any financial aid received.

External scholarships and grants: Scholarships and grants received from outside (private) sources that students
bring with them (e.g., Kiwanis, National Merit scholarships). The institution may process paperwork to receive the
dollars, but it has no role in determining the recipient or the dollar amount awarded.

Work study and employment: Federal and state work study aid, and any employment packaged by your institution
in financial aid awards.

DO NOT INCLUDE ANY AID RELATED TO THE CARES ACT OR UNIQUE THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC

                              I. INSTRUCTIONAL FACULTY AND CLASS SIZE

I-1. Please report the number of instructional faculty members in each category for Fall 2022. Include
faculty who are on your institution’s payroll on the census date your institution uses for IPEDS/AAUP.

The following definition of full-time instructional faculty is used by the American Association of University Professors
(AAUP) in its annual Faculty Compensation Survey (the part time definitions are not used by AAUP). Instructional
Faculty is defined as those members of the instructional-research staff whose major regular assignment is
instruction, including those with released time for research. Use the chart below to determine inclusions and
exclusions:

I-3. Undergraduate Class Size

In the table below, please use the following definitions to report information about the size of classes and class
sections offered in the Fall 2022 term.

       Please include classes that have been moved online in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Class Sections: A class section is an organized course offered for credit, identified by discipline and number,
meeting at a stated time or times in a classroom or similar setting, and not a subsection such as a laboratory or
discussion session. Undergraduate class sections are defined as any sections in which at least one degree-seeking
undergraduate student is enrolled for credit. Exclude distance learning classes and noncredit classes and individual
instruction such as dissertation or thesis research, music instruction, or one-to-one readings. Exclude students in
independent study, co-operative programs, internships, foreign language taped tutor sessions, practicums, and all
students in one-on-one classes. Each class section should be counted only once and should not be duplicated
because of course catalog cross-listings.

Class Subsections: A class subsection includes any subsection of a course, such as laboratory, recitation, and
discussion subsections that are supplementary in nature and are scheduled to meet separately from the lecture
portion of the course. Undergraduate subsections are defined as any subsections of courses in which degree-
seeking undergraduate students enrolled for credit. As above, exclude noncredit classes and individual instruction
such as dissertation or thesis research, music instruction, or one-to-one readings. Each class subsection should be
counted only once and should not be duplicated because of cross-listings.

Using the above definitions, please report for each of the following class-size intervals the number of class sections
and class subsections offered in Fall 2022. For example, a lecture class with 800 students who met at another time
in 40 separate labs with 20 students should be counted once in the “100+” column in the class section column and
40 times under the “20-29” column of the class subsections table.

Degrees conferred between July 1, 2021 and June 30, 2022

For each of the following discipline areas, provide the percentage of diplomas/certificates, associate, and bachelor’s
degrees awarded. To determine the percentage, use majors, not headcount (e.g., students with one degree but a
double major will be represented twice). Calculate the percentage from your institution’s IPEDS Completions by
using the sum of 1st and 2nd majors for each CIP code as the numerator and the sum of the Grand Total by 1st
Majors and the Grand Total by 2nd major as the denominator. If you prefer, you can compute the percentages using
1st majors only.

External scholarships and grants: Scholarships and grants received from outside (private) sources that students bring with
them (e.g., Kiwanis, National Merit scholarships). The institution may process paperwork to receive the dollars, but it has no role
in determining the recipient or the dollar amount awarded.

Financial aid applicant: Any applicant who submits any one of the institutionally required financial aid applications/forms, such
as the FAFSA.

Indebtedness: Aggregate dollar amount borrowed through any loan program (federal, state, subsidized, unsubsidized, private,
etc.; excluding parent loans) while the student was enrolled at an institution. Student loans co-signed by a parent are assumed
to be the responsibility of the student and should be included.

Institutional scholarships and grants: Endowed scholarships, annual gifts and tuition funded grants for which the institution
determines the recipient.

Financial need: As determined by your institution using the federal methodology and/or your institution's own standards.

Need-based aid: College-funded or college-administered award from institutional, state, federal, or other sources for which a
student must have financial need to qualify. This includes both institutional and non-institutional student aid (grants, jobs, and

or other sources (including unrestricted funds or gifts and endowment income) awarded solely on the basis of academic
achievement, merit, or any other non-need-based reason. When reporting questions H1 and H2, non-need-based aid that is
used to meet need should be counted as need-based aid.

    Note: Suggested order of precedence for counting non-need money as need-based:

                1.   Non-need institutional grants                                      6.   Non-need outside grants
                2.   Non-need tuition waivers                                           7.   Non-need student loans
