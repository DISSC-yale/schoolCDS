G1 Undergraduate full-time tuition, required fees, room and board List the typical tuition,
   required fees, and room and board for a full-time undergraduate student for the FULL 2006-
   2007 academic year (30 semester or 45 quarter hours for institutions that derive annual tuition
   by multiplying credit hour cost by number of credits). A full academic year refers to the period
   of time generally extending from September to June; usually equated to two semesters, two
   trimesters, three quarters, or the period covered by a four-one-four plan. Room and board is
   defined as double occupancy and 19 meals per week or the maximum meal plan. Required
   fees include only charges that all full-time students must pay that are not included in tuition
   (e.g., registration, health, or activity fees.) Do not include optional fees (e.g., parking, laboratory
   use).

     undergraduates) in the following categories. (Note: If the data being reported are final figures for

     Question B1 cohort.) Include aid awarded to international students (i.e., those not qualifying for
     federal aid). Aid that is non-need-based but that was used to meet need should be reported

     Report the Fall 2005 ratio of full-time equivalent students (full-time plus 1/3 part time) to full-time
     equivalent instructional faculty (full time plus 1/3 part time). In the ratio calculations, exclude both
     faculty and students in stand-alone graduate or professional programs such as medicine, law,
     veterinary, dentistry, social work, business, or public health in which faculty teach virtually only
     graduate-level students. Do not count undergraduate or graduate student teaching assistants as
     faculty.

I2   Fall 2005 Student to Faculty ratio                     19.1 to 1       (based on        30336 students
                                                                                  and         1590 faculty).
I3   Undergraduate Class Size
     In the table below, please use the following definitions to report information about the size of classes
     and class sections offered in the Fall 2005 term.
     Class Sections: A class section is an organized course offered for credit, identified by discipline
     and number, meeting at a stated time or times in a classroom or similar setting, and not a
     subsection such as a laboratory or discussion session. Undergraduate class sections are defined as
     any sections in which at least one degree-seeking undergraduate student is enrolled for credit.
     Exclude distance learning classes and noncredit classes and individual instruction such as
     dissertation or thesis research, music instruction, or one-to-one readings. Exclude students in
     independent study, co-operative programs, internships, foreign language taped tutor sessions,
     practicums, and all students in one-on-one classes. Each class section should be counted only once
     and should not be duplicated because of course catalog cross-listings.
     Class Subsections: A class subsection includes any subsection of a course, such as laboratory,
     recitation, and discussion subsections that are supplementary in nature and are scheduled to meet
     separately from the lecture portion of the course. Undergraduate subsections are defined as any
     subsections of courses in which degree-seeking undergraduate students enrolled for credit. As
     above, exclude noncredit classes and individual instruction such as dissertation or thesis research,
     music instruction, or one-to-one readings. Each class subsection should be counted only once and
     should not be duplicated because of cross-listings.
     Using the above definitions, please report for each of the following class-size intervals the number of
     class sections and class subsections offered in Fall 2005. For example, a lecture class with 800
     students who met at another time in 40 separate labs with 20 students should be counted once in
     the “100+” column in the class section column and 40 times under the “20-29” column of the class
     subsections table.

                                   J. DEGREES CONFERRED
J1 Percentage of Degrees conferred between July 1, 2004 and June 30, 2005
J1 For each of the following discipline areas, provide the percentage of diplomas/certificates, associate, and
     bachelor’s degrees awarded. To determine the percentage, use majors, not headcount (e.g., students with
     one degree but a double major will be represented twice). Calculate the percentage from your institution’s
     IPEDS Completions by using the sum of 1st and 2nd majors for each CIP code as the numerator and the
     sum of the Grand Total by 1st Majors and the Grand Total by 2nd major as the denominator. If you prefer,
     you can compute the percentages using 1st majors only.

                                        Financial Aid Definitions

Awarded aid: The dollar amounts offered to financial aid applicants.
Financial aid applicant: Any applicant who submits any one of the institutionally required financial aid
applications/forms, such as the FAFSA.
Indebtedness: Aggregate dollar amount borrowed through any loan programs (federal, state, subsidized,
unsubsidized, private, etc.; excluding parent loans) while the student was enrolled at an institution.
Student loans co-signed by a parent are assumed to be the responsibility of the student and should be
included.
Institutional and external funds: Endowment, alumni, or external monies for which the institution
determines the recipient or the dollar amount awarded.
Financial need: As determined by your institution using the federal methodology and/or your institution's
own standards.
Need-based aid: College-funded or college-administered award from institutional, state, federal, or other
sources for which a student must have financial need to qualify. This includes both institutional and
noninstitutional student aid (grants, jobs, and loans).
Need-based scholarship or grant aid: Scholarships and grants from institutional, state, federal, or other
sources for which a student must have financial need to qualify.
Need-based self-help aid: Loans and jobs from institutional, state, federal, or other sources for which a
student must demonstrate financial need to qualify.
Non-need-based scholarship or grant aid: Scholarships and grants, gifts, or merit-based aid from
institutional, state, federal, or other sources (including unrestricted funds or gifts and endowment income)
awarded solely on the basis of academic achievement, merit, or any other non-need-based reason. When
reporting questions H1 and H2, non-need-based aid that is used to meet need should be counted as
need-based aid.
Note: Suggested order of precedence for counting non-need money as need-based:
Non-need institutional grants
Non-need tuition waivers
Non-need athletic awards
Non-need federal grants
Non-need state grants
Non-need outside grants
Non-need student loans
Non-need parent loans
Non-need work
Non-need-based self-help aid: Loans and jobs from institutional, state, or other sources for which a
student need not demonstrate financial need to qualify.
Scholarships/grants from external sources: Monies received from outside (private) sources that the
student brings with them (e.g., Kiwanis, National Merit scholarships). The institution may process
paperwork to receive the dollars, but it has no role in determining the recipient or the dollar amount
awarded.
Work study and employment: Federal and state work study aid, and any employment packaged by your
institution in financial aid awards.
