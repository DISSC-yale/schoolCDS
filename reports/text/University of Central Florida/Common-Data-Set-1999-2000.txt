Freshman Profile

Provide percentages for ALL enrolled degree-seeking full-time and part-time, first-time, first-year
(freshman) students enrolled in fall 1999, including students who began studies during summer, international
students/nonresident aliens, and students admitted under special arrangements.

national standardized (SAT/ACT) test scores. Include information for ALL enrolled, first-time, first-year
(freshman) degree-seeking students who submitted test scores. Do not include partial test scores (e.g.,
mathematics scores but not verbal for a category of students) or combine other standardized test results (such as

counted as full-time undergraduates.

I. INSTRUCTIONAL FACULTY AND CLASS SIZE

I-1. Please report number of instructional faculty members in each category for Fall 1999.

The following definition of instructional faculty is used by the American Association of University Professors
(AAUP) in its
annual Faculty Compensation Survey. Instructional Faculty is defined as those members of the instructional-
research staff
whose major regular assignment is instruction, including those with released time for research. Institutions are
asked to
   EXCLUDE:
   (a) instructional faculty in preclinical and clinical medicine
   (b) administrative officers with titles such as dean of students, librarian, registrar, coach, and the like, even
though they may devote part of their time to classroom instruction and may have faculty status,
   (c) undergraduate or graduate students who assist in the instruction of courses, but have titles such as teaching
assistant,
   teaching fellow, and the like
   (d) faculty on leave without pay, and
   (e) replacement faculty for faculty on sabbatical leave.

  Full-time: faculty employed on a full-time basis
  Part-time: faculty teaching less than two semesters, three quarters, two trimesters, or two four-month sessions.
Also includes adjuncts and part-time instructors.
  Minority faculty: includes faculty who designate themselves as black, non-Hispanic; American Indian or
Alaskan native;
  Asian or Pacific Islander; or Hispanic.
  Doctorate: includes Ph.D., Ed.D in education, DMA in musical arts, DBA in business administration, D. Eng or
DES in
  engineering.
  First-professional: includes the fields of dentistry (DDS or DMD), medicine (MD), optometry (OD), osteopathic
medicine (DO), pharmacy (DPharm or BPharm), podiatric medicine (DPM), veterinary medicine (DVM),

chiropractic (DC or DCM), law (JD) and theological professions (MDiv, MHL).

 Terminal degree: the highest degree in a field: example, M. Arch (architecture) and MFA (master of fine arts).
                                                                  Full-time         Part-time        Total

I-2. Student to Faculty Ratio

Report the Fall 1999 ratio of full-time equivalent students (full-time plus 1/3 part time) to full-time equivalent
instructional faculty (full time plus 1/3 part time). In the ratio calculations, exclude both faculty and students in
stand-alone graduate or professional programs such as medicine, law, veterinary, dentistry, social work, business,
or public health in which faculty
teach virtually only graduate level students. Do not count undergraduate or graduate student teaching assistants as
faculty.

Fall 1999 Student to Faculty ratio:             20.6 to 1

I-3. Undergraduate Class Size

In the table below, please use the following definitions to report information about the size of classes and class
sections offered in the Fall 1999 term.

Class Sections: A class section is an organized course offered for credit, identified by discipline and number,
meeting at a stated time or times in a classroom or similar setting, and not a subsection such as a laboratory or
discussion session. Undergraduate class sections are defined as any sections in which at least one degree-seeking
undergraduate student is
enrolled for credit. Exclude distance learning classes and noncredit classes and individual instruction such as
dissertation or thesis research, music instruction, or one-to-one readings. Exclude students in independent study,
co-operative programs, internships, foreign language taped tutor sessions, practicums, and all students in one-on-
one classes. Each class section
should be counted only once and should not be duplicated because of course catalog cross-listings.

Class Subsections: A class subsection includes any subsection of a course, such as laboratory, recitation, and
discussion subsections that are supplementary in nature and are scheduled to meet separately from the lecture
portion of the course. Undergraduate subsections are defined as any subsections of courses in which degree-
seeking undergraduate students
enrolled for credit. As above, exclude noncredit classes and individual instruction such as dissertation or thesis
research, music instruction, or one-to-one readings. Each class subsection should be counted only once and should
not be duplicated because of cross-listings.

Using the above definitions, please report for each of the following class-size intervals the number of class
sections and class subsections offered in Fall 1999. For example, a lecture class with 800 students who met at
another time in 40 separate labs with 20 students should be counted once in the "100+" column in the class section

column and 40 times under the "20-29" column of the class subsections table.
