item below), use the 2002-2003 academic year's CDS Question B1 cohort.) Include aid awarded to
international students (i.e., those not qualifying for federal aid). Aid that is non-need-based but that was
used to meet need should be reported in the need-based aid columns. (For a suggested order of precedence
in assigning categories of aid to cover need, see the entry for "non-need-based scholarship or grant aid" on
the last page of the definitions section).

I. INSTRUCTIONAL FACULTY AND CLASS SIZE

I-1. Please report number of instructional faculty members in each category for Fall 2003.

The following definition of instructional faculty is used by the American Association of University Professors
(AAUP) in its annual Faculty Compensation Survey. Instructional Faculty is defined as those members of the
instructional-research staff whose major regular assignment is instruction, including those with released time
for research. Institutions are asked to EXCLUDE:
   (a) instructional faculty in preclinical and clinical medicine
   (b) administrative officers with titles such as dean of students, librarian, registrar, coach, and the like,
even though they may devote part of their time to classroom instruction and may have faculty status,
   (c) undergraduate or graduate students who assist in the instruction of courses, but have titles such as
teaching assistant,

  teaching fellow, and the like
  (d) faculty on leave without pay, and
  (e) replacement faculty for faculty on sabbatical leave.

   Full-time: faculty employed on a full-time basis
   Part-time: faculty teaching less than two semesters, three quarters, two trimesters, or two four-month
sessions. Also includes adjuncts and part-time instructors.
   Minority faculty: includes faculty who designate themselves as black, non-Hispanic; American Indian or
Alaskan native; Asian or Pacific Islander; or Hispanic.
   Doctorate: includes such degrees as Doctor of Education, Doctor of Juridical Science, Doctor of Public
Health, and Doctor of Philosophy degree in any field such as agronomy, food technology, education,
engineering, public administration, ophthalmology, or radiology.
   First-professional: includes the fields of dentistry (DDS or DMD), medicine (MD), optometry (OD),
osteopathic medicine (DO), pharmacy (DPharm or BPharm), podiatric medicine (DPM), veterinary medicine
(DVM), chiropractic (DC or DCM), law (JD) and theological professions (MDiv, MHL).

   Terminal degree: the highest degree in a field: example, M. Arch (architecture) and MFA (master of fine
arts).
                                                                    Full-time Part-time        Total

I-2. Student to Faculty Ratio

Report the Fall 2003 ratio of full-time equivalent students (full-time plus 1/3 part time) to full-time equivalent
instructional faculty (full time plus 1/3 part time). In the ratio calculations, exclude both faculty and students
in stand-alone graduate or professional programs such as medicine, law, veterinary, dentistry, social work,
business, or public health in which faculty teach virtually only graduate level students. Do not count
undergraduate or graduate student teaching assistants as faculty.

24.9 to 1

I-3. Undergraduate Class Size

In the table below, please use the following definitions to report information about the size of classes and
class sections offered in the Fall 2003 term.

Class Sections: A class section is an organized course offered for credit, identified by discipline and number,
meeting at a stated time or times in a classroom or similar setting, and not a subsection such as a laboratory
or discussion session. Undergraduate class sections are defined as any sections in which at least one degree-
seeking undergraduate student is enrolled for credit. Exclude distance learning classes and noncredit classes
and individual instruction such as dissertation or thesis research, music instruction, or one-to-one readings.
Exclude students in independent study, co-operative programs, internships, foreign language taped tutor
sessions, practicums, and all students in one-on-one classes. Each class section should be counted only once
and should not be duplicated because of course catalog cross-listings.

Class Subsections: A class subsection includes any subsection of a course, such as laboratory, recitation,
and discussion subsections that are supplementary in nature and are scheduled to meet separately from the
lecture portion of the course. Undergraduate subsections are defined as any subsections of courses in which
degree-seeking undergraduate students are enrolled for credit. As above, exclude noncredit classes and
individual instruction such as dissertation or thesis research, music instruction, or one-to-one readings. Each
class subsection should be counted only once and should not be duplicated because of cross-listings.

Using the above definitions, please report for each of the following class-size intervals the number of class
sections and class subsections offered in Fall 2003. For example, a lecture class with 800 students who met at
