year (see the next item below), use the 2003-2004 academic year's CDS Question B1 cohort.) Include aid
awarded to international students (i.e., those not qualifying for federal aid). Aid that is non-need-based but
that was used to meet need should be reported in the need-based aid columns. (For a suggested order of
precedence in assigning categories of aid to cover need, see the entry for "non-need-based scholarship or
grant aid" on the last page of the definitions section).

I-2. Student to Faculty Ratio

Report the Fall 2004 ratio of full-time equivalent students (full-time plus 1/3 part time) to full-time equivalent
instructional faculty (full time plus 1/3 part time). In the ratio calculations, exclude both faculty and students
in stand-alone graduate or professional programs such as medicine, law, veterinary, dentistry, social work,
business, or public health in which faculty teach virtually only graduate level students. Do not count
undergraduate or graduate student teaching assistants as faculty.

25.4 to 1 (based on _34103_ FTE students and _1339_ FTE faculty)

I-3. Undergraduate Class Size

In the table below, please use the following definitions to report information about the size of classes and
class sections offered in the Fall 2004 term.

Class Sections: A class section is an organized course offered for credit, identified by discipline and number,
meeting at a stated time or times in a classroom or similar setting, and not a subsection such as a laboratory
or discussion session. Undergraduate class sections are defined as any sections in which at least one degree-
seeking undergraduate student is enrolled for credit. Exclude distance learning classes and noncredit classes
and individual instruction such as dissertation or thesis research, music instruction, or one-to-one readings.
Exclude students in independent study, co-operative programs, internships, foreign language taped tutor
sessions, practicums, and all students in one-on-one classes. Each class section should be counted only once
and should not be duplicated because of course catalog cross-listings.

Class Subsections: A class subsection includes any subsection of a course, such as laboratory, recitation,
and discussion subsections that are supplementary in nature and are scheduled to meet separately from the
lecture portion of the course. Undergraduate subsections are defined as any subsections of courses in which
degree-seeking undergraduate students are enrolled for credit. As above, exclude noncredit classes and
individual instruction such as dissertation or thesis research, music instruction, or one-to-one readings. Each
class subsection should be counted only once and should not be duplicated because of cross-listings.

Using the above definitions, please report for each of the following class-size intervals the number of class
sections and class subsections offered in Fall 2003. For example, a lecture class with 800 students who met at
another time in 40 separate labs with 20 students should be counted once in the "100+" column in the class
section column and 40 times under the "20-29" column of the class subsections table.

J. DEGREES CONFERRED

Degrees conferred between July 1, 2003 and June 30, 2004

For each of the following discipline areas, provide the percentage of diplomas/certificates, associate, and
bachelor's degrees awarded. To determine the percentage, use majors, not headcount (e.g., students with
one degree but a double major will be represented twice). Calculate the percentage from your institutions
Completions by using ghe sum of 1st and 2nd majors for each CIP code as the numerator and the sum of the
Grand Total by 1st Majors and the Grand Total by 2nd major as the denominator. If you prefer, you can
compute the percentages using 1st majors only.
