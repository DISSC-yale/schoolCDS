Aid Awarded to Enrolled Undergraduates

H1. Enter total dollar amounts awarded to enrolled full-time and less than full-time degree-seeking
undergraduates (using the same cohort reported in CDS Question B1, "total degree-seeking"
undergraduates) in the following categories. (Note: If the data being reported are final figures for the

faculty and students in stand-alone graduate or professional programs such as medicine, law,

veterinary, dentistry, social work, business, or public health in which faculty teach virtually only
graduate level students. Do not count undergraduate or graduate student teaching assistants as
faculty.

27.8 to 1 (based on _37,669_ FTE students and _1356_ FTE faculty)

I-3. Undergraduate Class Size

In the table below, please use the following definitions to report information about the size of classes
and class sections offered in the Fall 2006 term.

Class Sections: A class section is an organized course offered for credit, identified by discipline and
number, meeting at a stated time or times in a classroom or similar setting, and not a subsection such
as a laboratory or discussion session. Undergraduate class sections are defined as any sections in
which at least one degree-seeking undergraduate student is enrolled for credit. Exclude distance
learning classes and noncredit classes and individual instruction such as dissertation or thesis
research, music instruction, or one-to-one readings. Exclude students in independent study, co-
operative programs, internships, foreign language taped tutor sessions, practicums, and all students in
one-on-one classes. Each class section should be counted only once and should not be duplicated
because of course catalog cross-listings.

Class Subsections: A class subsection includes any subsection of a course, such as laboratory,
recitation, and discussion subsections that are supplementary in nature and are scheduled to meet
separately from the lecture portion of the course. Undergraduate subsections are defined as any
subsections of courses in which degree-seeking undergraduate students are enrolled for credit. As
above, exclude noncredit classes and individual instruction such as dissertation or thesis research,
music instruction, or one-to-one readings. Each class subsection should be counted only once and
should not be duplicated because of cross-listings.

Using the above definitions, please report for each of the following class-size intervals the number of
class sections and class subsections offered in Fall 2006. For example, a lecture class with 800
students who met at another time in 40 separate labs with 20 students should be counted once in the
"100+" column in the class section column and 40 times under the "20-29" column of the class
subsections table.

J. DEGREES CONFERRED

Degrees conferred between July 1, 2005 and June 30, 2006

For each of the following discipline areas, provide the percentage of diplomas/certificates, associate,
and bachelor's degrees awarded. To determine the percentage, use majors, not headcount (e.g.,
students with one degree but a double major will be represented twice). Calculate the percentage from
your institutions Completions by using the sum of 1st and 2nd majors for each CIP code as the
numerator and the sum of the Grand Total by 1st Majors and the Grand Total by 2nd major as the
denominator. If you prefer, you can compute the percentages using 1st majors only.

which the institution determines the recipient.

Financial need: As determined by your institution using the federal methodology and/or your
institution's own standards.

Non-need institutional grants

Non-need tuition waivers

paperwork to receive the dollars, but it has no role in determining the recipient or the dollar amount
awarded.
