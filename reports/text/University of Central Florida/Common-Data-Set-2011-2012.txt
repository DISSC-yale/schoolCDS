institution.

G1. Undergraduate full-time tuition, required fees, room and board

   List the typical tuition, required fees, and room and board for a full-time undergraduate student for the
FULL 2012-2013 academic year (30 semesters hours or 45 quarter hours for institutions that derive annual
tuition by multiplying credit hour cost by number of credits). A full academic year refers to the period of
time generally extending from September to June; usually equated to two semesters or trimesters, three
quarters, or the period covered by a four-one-four plan. Room and board is defined as double occupancy
and 19 meals per week or the maximum meal plan. Required fees include only charges that all full-time
students must pay that are not included in tuition (e.g., registration, health, or activity fees.) Do not
include optional fees (e.g. parking, laboratory use).

H. FINANCIAL AID

Aid Awarded to Enrolled Undergraduates

H1. Enter total dollar amounts awarded to enrolled full-time and less than full-time degree-seeking
undergraduates (using the same cohort reported in CDS Question B1, "total degree-seeking"
undergraduates) in the following categories. (Note: If the data being reported are final figures for the 2010-
2011 academic year (see the next item below), use the 2010-2011 academic year's CDS Question B1
cohort.) Include aid awarded to international students (i.e., those not qualifying for federal aid). Aid that is
non-need-based but that was used to meet need should be reported in the need-based aid columns. (For a
suggested order of precedence in assigning categories of aid to cover need, see the entry for "non-need-
based scholarship or grant aid" on the last page of the definitions section).

I-2. Student to Faculty Ratio

Report the Fall 2011 ratio of full-time equivalent students (full-time plus 1/3 part time) to full-time
equivalent instructional faculty (full time plus 1/3 part time). In the ratio calculations, exclude both faculty
and students in stand-alone graduate or professional programs such as medicine, law, veterinary, dentistry,
social work, business, or public health in which faculty teach virtually only graduate level students. Do not
count undergraduate or graduate student teaching assistants as faculty.

31.7 to 1 (based on _46975_ FTE students and _1483_ FTE faculty)

I-3. Undergraduate Class Size

In the table below, please use the following definitions to report information about the size of classes and
class sections offered in the Fall 2011 term.

Class Sections: A class section is an organized course offered for credit, identified by discipline and
number, meeting at a stated time or times in a classroom or similar setting, and not a subsection such as a
laboratory or discussion session. Undergraduate class sections are defined as any sections in which at least
one degree-seeking undergraduate student is enrolled for credit. Exclude distance learning classes and
noncredit classes and individual instruction such as dissertation or thesis research, music instruction, or one-
to-one readings. Exclude students in independent study, co-operative programs, internships, foreign
language taped tutor sessions, practicums, and all students in one-on-one classes. Each class section should
be counted only once and should not be duplicated because of course catalog cross-listings.

Class Subsections: A class subsection includes any subsection of a course, such as laboratory, recitation,
and discussion subsections that are supplementary in nature and are scheduled to meet separately from the
lecture portion of the course. Undergraduate subsections are defined as any subsections of courses in which
degree-seeking undergraduate students are enrolled for credit. As above, exclude noncredit classes and
individual instruction such as dissertation or thesis research, music instruction, or one-to-one readings. Each
class subsection should be counted only once and should not be duplicated because of cross-listings.

Using the above definitions, please report for each of the following class-size intervals the number of class
sections and class subsections offered in Fall 2011. For example, a lecture class with 800 students who met
at another time in 40 separate labs with 20 students should be counted once in the "100+" column in the
class section column and 40 times under the "20-29" column of the class subsections table.

J. DEGREES CONFERRED

Degrees conferred between July 1, 2010 and June 30, 2011

For each of the following discipline areas, provide the percentage of diplomas/certificates, associate, and
bachelor's degrees awarded. To determine the percentage, use majors, not headcount (e.g., students with
one degree but a double major will be represented twice). Calculate the percentage from your institutions
Completions by using the sum of 1st and 2nd majors for each CIP code as the numerator and the sum of the
Grand Total by 1st Majors and the Grand Total by 2nd major as the denominator. If you prefer, you can
compute the percentages using 1st majors only.
