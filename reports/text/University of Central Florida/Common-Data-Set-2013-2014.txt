I-2. Student to Faculty Ratio

Report the Fall 2013 ratio of full-time equivalent students (full-time plus 1/3 part time) to full-time
equivalent instructional faculty (full time plus 1/3 part time). In the ratio calculations, exclude both
faculty and students in stand-alone graduate or professional programs such as medicine, law,
veterinary, dentistry, social work, business, or public health in which faculty teach virtually only
graduate level students. Do not count undergraduate or graduate student teaching assistants as faculty.

Fall 2013 Student to Faculty ratio: 31.1 to 1 (based on 46,478 FTE students and 1,494 FTE faculty).

I-3. Undergraduate Class Size

In the table below, please use the following definitions to report information about the size of classes
and class sections offered in the Fall 2013 term.

                                                                                                  P a g e | 27


Class Sections: A class section is an organized course offered for credit, identified by discipline and
number, meeting at a stated time or times in a classroom or similar setting, and not a subsection such
as a laboratory or discussion session. Undergraduate class sections are defined as any sections in which
at least one degree-seeking undergraduate student is enrolled for credit. Exclude distance learning
classes and noncredit classes and individual instruction such as dissertation or thesis research, music
instruction, or one-to-one readings. Exclude students in independent study, co-operative programs,
internships, foreign language taped tutor sessions, practicums, and all students in one-on-one classes.
Each class section should be counted only once and should not be duplicated because of course catalog
cross-listings.

Class Subsections: A class subsection includes any subsection of a course, such as laboratory,
recitation, and discussion subsections that are supplementary in nature and are scheduled to meet
separately from the lecture portion of the course. Undergraduate subsections are defined as any
subsections of courses in which degree-seeking undergraduate students enrolled for credit. As above,
exclude noncredit classes and individual instruction such as dissertation or thesis research, music
instruction, or one-to-one readings. Each class subsection should be counted only once and should not
be duplicated because of cross-listings.

Using the above definitions, please report for each of the following class-size intervals the number of
class sections and class subsections offered in Fall 2013. For example, a lecture class with 800 students
who met at another time in 40 separate labs with 20 students should be counted once in the “100+”
column in the class section column and 40 times under the “20-29” column of the class subsections
table.

J. DEGREES CONFERRED

Degrees conferred between July 1, 2012 and June 30, 2013

For each of the following discipline areas, provide the percentage of diplomas/certificates, associate, and
bachelor’s degrees awarded. To determine the percentage, use majors, not headcount (e.g., students
with one degree but a double major will be represented twice). Calculate the percentage from your
institution’s IPEDS Completions by using the sum of 1st and 2nd majors for each CIP code as the
numerator and the sum of the Grand Total by 1st Majors and the Grand Total by 2nd major as the
denominator. If you prefer, you can compute the percentages using 1st majors only.

                                                                                             P a g e | 28

adviser, who, through regular meetings, helps the student plan and implement immediate and long-
term academic and vocational goals.

Accelerated program: Completion of a college program of study in fewer than the usual number of
years, most often by attending summer sessions and carrying extra courses during the regular academic
term.

Admitted student: Applicant who is offered admission to a degree-granting program at your institution.

adults who have started college for the first time, or who are re-entering after a lapse of a few years.

considered for admission (including payment or waiving of the application fee, if any) and who has been
notified of one of the following actions: admission, nonadmission, placement on waiting list, or
application withdrawn (by applicant or institution).

Application fee: That amount of money that an institution charges for processing a student’s application

U.S. Department of Education) that normally requires at least four years but not more than five years of
full-time equivalent college-level work. This includes ALL bachelor’s degrees conferred in a five-year
cooperative (work-study plan) program. (A cooperative plan provides for alternate class attendance and
employment in business, industry, or government; thus, it allows students to combine actual work
experience with their college studies.) Also, it includes bachelor’s degrees in which the normal four years
of work are completed in three years.

Black or African American: A person having origins in any of the black racial groups of Africa.

Board (charges): Assume average cost for 19 meals per week or the maximum meal plan.

Contact hour: A unit of measure that represents an hour of scheduled instruction given to students. Also
referred to as clock hour.

Continuous basis (for program enrollment): A calendar system classification that is used by institutions
that enroll students at any time during the academic year. For example, a cosmetology school or a word
processing school might allow students to enroll and begin studies at various times, with no requirement
that classes begin on a certain date.

Cooperative education program: A program that provides for alternate class attendance and
employment in business, industry, or government.

Cooperative housing: College-owned, -operated, or -affiliated housing in which students share room and

can be applied by a recipient toward the requirements for a degree, diploma, certificate, or other formal
award.

Credit course: A course that, if successfully completed, can be applied toward the number of courses
required for achieving a degree, diploma, certificate, or other formal award.

Credit hour: A unit of measure representing an hour (50 minutes) of instruction over a 15-week period

enrolled in vocational or occupational programs.

accept an offer of admission and, if admitted, to withdraw their applications from other colleges. There

                                                                                                 P a g e | 32

Indebtedness: Aggregate dollar amount borrowed through any loan program (federal, state, subsidized,

Student loans co-signed by a parent are assumed to be the responsibility of the student and should be
included.

                                                                                                P a g e | 37
