B2. Enrollment by Racial/Ethnic Category
Provide numbers of undergraduate students for each of the following categories as of the institution’s official fall reporting date or as of
October 15, 2023.

1. Include international students only in the category "Nonresidents."

2. Complete the “Total Undergraduates” column only if you cannot provide data for the first two columns.

3. Report as your institution reports to IPEDS: persons who are Hispanic should be reported only on the Hispanic line, not under any race,
and persons who are non‐Hispanic multi‐racial should be reported only under "Two or more races."

4. New guidance from IPEDS for reporting aggregate data: "Racial/ethnic designations are requested only for United States citizens,
residents, and other eligible non‐citizens. Eligible non‐citizens include all students who completed high school or a GED equivalency within
the United States (including DACA and undocumented students) and who were not on an F‐1 non‐immigrant student visa at the time of
high school gradua on."

5. More information about other eligible (for financial aid purposes) non‐citizens is available at
https://studentaid.gov/understandaid/eligibility/requirements/non‐us‐citizens.

6. Nonresident – A person who is not a citizen or national of the United States and who is in this country on a student visa or temporary
basis and does not have the right to remain indefinitely. Do not include DACA, undocumented, or other eligible noncitizens in this
category. Nonresidents are to be reported separately, in the boxes provided, rather than included in any of the seven racial/ethnic
categories or in race/ethnicity unknown.

B22. Retention Rates

Report for the cohort of all full‐time, first‐time bachelor’s (or equivalent) degree‐seeking undergraduate students who entered
in Fall 2022 (or the preceding summer term).

The initial cohort may be adjusted for students who departed for the following reasons:

* Death
* Permanent Disability
* Service in the armed forces
* Foreign aid service of the federal government
* Oﬃcial church missions
* No other adjustments to the ini al cohort should be made.

For the cohort of all full‐time bachelor’s (or equivalent) degree‐seeking undergraduate students who entered your institution
as first‐year students in Fall 2022 (or the preceding summer term), what percentage was enrolled at your institution as of the
date your institution calculates its official enrollment in Fall 2023.

Total students retained = students from the Fall 2022 cohort who are still enrolled as of Fall 2023 + students from

Note: The number of first‐time students seeking a bachelor’s degree (or equivalent) who attain a bachelor’s degree (or
equivalent) by their second fall term is expected to be zero or very small. In exceptional cases when a first‐time student does
satisfy all degree requirements including full credit completion (e.g., typically 120 credit hours) and is awarded a bachelor’s
degree (or equivalent) by their second fall term, they are to be considered “retained” for EF reporting purposes.

 A full academic year refers to the period of time generally extending from September to June; usually equated to two semesters, two
trimesters, three quarters, or the period covered by a four-one-four plan.
 Food and housing is defined as double occupancy and 19 meals per week or the maximum meal plan.

                                                           H. FINANCIAL AID

Please refer to the following financial aid definitions when completing Section H.

Awarded aid: The dollar amounts offered to financial aid applicants.

Financial aid applicant: Any applicant who submits any one of the institutionally required financial aid applications/forms, such as the FAFSA.

Indebtedness: Aggregate dollar amount borrowed through any loan program (federal, state, subsidized, unsubsidized, private, etc.; excluding
parent loans) while the student was enrolled at an institution. Student loans co‐signed by a parent are assumed to be the responsibility of the
student and should be included.

Institutional scholarships and grants: Endowed scholarships, annual gifts and tuition funded grants for which the institution determines the
recipient.

Financial need: As determined by your institution using the federal methodology and/or your institution's own standards.

Need‐based aid: College‐funded or college‐administered award from institutional, state, federal, or other sources for which a student must
have financial need to qualify. This includes both institutional and non‐institutional student aid (grants, jobs, and loans).

Need‐based scholarship or grant aid: Scholarships and grants from institutional, state, federal, or other sources for which a student must
have financial need to qualify.

Need‐based self‐help aid: Loans and jobs from institutional, state, federal, or other sources for which a student must demonstrate financial
need to qualify.

Non‐need‐based scholarship or grant aid: Scholarships and grants, gifts, or merit‐based aid from institutional, state, federal, or other sources
(including unrestricted funds or gifts and endowment income) awarded solely on the basis of academic achievement, merit, or any other non‐
need‐based reason. When reporting questions H1 and H2, non‐need‐based aid that is used to meet need should be counted as need‐based
aid.




Note: Suggested order of precedence for counting non‐need money as need‐based:

1. Non‐need ins tu onal grants           6. Non‐need outside grants
2. Non‐need tui on waivers               7. Non‐need student loans
3. Non‐need athle c awards               8. Non‐need parent loans
4. Non‐need federal grants               9. Non‐need work
5. Non‐need state grants

Non‐need‐based self‐help aid: Loans and jobs from institutional, state, or other sources for which a student need not demonstrate financial
need to qualify.

Private student loans: A nonfederal loan made by a lender such as a bank, credit union or private lender used to pay for up to the annual
cost of education, less any financial aid received.

External scholarships and grants: Scholarships and grants received from outside (private) sources that students bring with them (e.g.,
Kiwanis, National Merit scholarships). The institution may process paperwork to receive the dollars, but it has no role in determining the
recipient or the dollar amount awarded.

Work study and employment: Federal and state work study aid, and any employment packaged by your institution in financial aid awards.



H1. Aid Awarded to Enrolled Undergraduates
Enter total dollar amounts awarded to enrolled full‐time and less than full‐time degree‐seeking undergraduates (using the same cohort
reported in CDS Question B1, “total degree‐seeking” undergraduates) in the following categories.

        Cohort.
        ✔ Include aid awarded to international students (i.e., those not qualifying for federal aid).
        ✔ Aid that is non-need-based but that was used to meet need should be reported in the need-based aid column.
        ✔ For a suggested order of precedence in assigning categories of aid to cover need, see the entry for “non-need-based
        scholarship or grant aid” on the last page of the definitions section.

                          Do NOT include any aid related to the CARES Act or unique to the COVID‐19 pandemic.

I3. Undergraduate Class Size
In the table below, please report information about the size of classes and class sections offered in the Fall 2023 term.

Class Sections: A class section is an organized course offered for credit, identified by discipline and number, meeting at a stated time or
times in a classroom or similar setting, and not a subsection such as a laboratory or discussion session. Undergraduate class sections are
defined as any sections in which at least one degree‐seeking undergraduate student is enrolled for credit. Exclude distance learning classes
and noncredit classes and individual instruction such as dissertation or thesis research, music instruction, or one‐to‐one readings. Exclude
students in independent study, co‐operative programs, internships, foreign language taped tutor sessions, practicums, and all students in
one‐on‐one classes. Each class section should be counted only once and should not be duplicated because of course catalog cross‐listings.

Class Subsections: A class subsection includes any subsection of a course, such as laboratory, recitation, and discussion subsections that are
supplementary in nature and are scheduled to meet separately from the lecture portion of the course. Undergraduate subsections are
defined as any subsections of courses in which degree‐seeking undergraduate students enrolled for credit. As above, exclude noncredit
classes and individual instruction such as dissertation or thesis research, music instruction, or one‐to‐one readings. Each class subsection
should be counted only once and should not be duplicated because of cross‐listings.


Using the above definitions, please report for each of the following class‐size intervals the number of class sections and class subsections
offered in Fall 2023. For example, a lecture class with 800 students who met at another time in 40 separate labs with 20 students should be
counted once in the “100+” column in the class section column and 40 times under the “20‐29” column of the class subsections table.
