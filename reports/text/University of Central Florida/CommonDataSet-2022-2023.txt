Graduation Rates
The items in this section correspond to data elements collected by the IPEDS Web-based Data Collection
System’s Graduation Rate Survey (GRS). For complete instructions and definitions of data elements,
see the IPEDS GRS Forms and Instructions for the 2022-2023 Survey.

In the following section for bachelor’s or equivalent programs, please disaggregate the Fall 2015 and Fall
2016 cohorts (formerly CDS B4-B11) into four groups:
•    Students who received a Federal Pell Grant*
•    Recipients of a subsidized Stafford Loan who did not receive a Pell Grant
•    Students who did not receive either a Pell Grant or a subsidized Stafford Loan
•    Total (all students, regardless of Pell Grant or subsidized loan status)

*Students who received both a Federal Pell Grant and a subsidized Stafford Loan should be reported in
the "Recipients of a Federal Pell Grant" column.
For each graduation rate grid below, the numbers in the first three columns for Questions A-G should
sum to the cohort total in the fourth column (formerly CDS B4-B11).

                                                                                                   P age |6

C. FIRST-TIME, FIRST-YEAR ADMISSION

Applications

C1. First-time, first-year students

Provide the number of degree-seeking, first-time, first-year students who applied, were admitted, and
enrolled (full- or part-time) in Fall 2022. Include early decision, early action, and students who began
studies during summer in this cohort. Applicants should include only those students who fulfilled the
requirements for consideration for admission (i.e., who completed actionable applications) and who have
been notified of one of the following actions: admission, non-admission, placement on waiting list, or
application withdrawn (by applicant or institution). Admitted applicants should include wait-listed
students who were subsequently offered admission. Since the total may include students who did not
provide gender data, the detail need not sum to the total. If your institution collects and reports non-
binary gender data, please use the “Another Gender” category. Note that recent high school graduates
and other students without prior postsecondary experience will still be considered “first-time students”
for fall enrollment reporting purposes even if they enrolled in the summer prior to fall enrollment.

First-time, first-year Profile

Provide information for ALL enrolled, degree-seeking, full-time and part-time, first-time, first-
year students enrolled in Fall 2022, including students who began studies during summer, international
students/nonresidents, and students admitted under special arrangements.

C9. Percent and number of first-time, first-year students enrolled in Fall 2022 who submitted
national standardized (SAT/ACT) test scores. Include information for ALL enrolled, degree-
seeking, first-time, first-year students who submitted test scores. Do not include partial test
scores (e.g., mathematics scores but not critical reading for a category of students) or combine other
standardized test results (such as TOEFL) in this item. Do not convert SAT scores to ACT scores and vice
versa.

If a student submitted multiple sets of scores for a single test, report this information
according to how you use the data. For example:
    • If you consider the highest scores from either submission, use the highest combination of
       scores (e.g., verbal from one submission, math from the other).
    • If you average the scores, use the average to report the scores.

 Percent submitting ACT scores      28.6%      Number submitting ACT scores       2,145



For each assessment listed below, report the score that represents the 25th percentile (the score that 25
percent of the first-time, first year population scored at or below) and the 75th percentile score (the
score that 25 percent scored at or above).

G. ANNUAL EXPENSES

G0. Please provide the URL of your institution’s net price calculator:
https://www.ucf.edu/financial-aid/resources/net-price-calculator/

Provide 2023-2024 academic year costs of attendance for the following categories that are applicable to
your institution.

G1. Undergraduate full-time tuition, required fees, room and board

List the typical tuition, required fees, and room and board for a full-time undergraduate student for the
FULL 2023-2024 academic year (30 semester hours or 45 quarter hours for institutions that derive
annual tuition by multiplying credit hour cost by number of credits). A full academic year refers to the
period of time generally extending from September to June; usually equated to two semesters, two
trimesters, three quarters, or the period covered by a four-one-four plan. Room and board is defined
as double occupancy and 19 meals per week or the maximum meal plan. Required fees include only
charges that all full-time students must pay that are not included in tuition (e.g., registration, health, or
activity fees.) Do not include optional fees (e.g., parking, laboratory use).

                                                                                              P a g e | 22

I-2. Student to Faculty Ratio

Report the Fall 2022 ratio of full-time equivalent students (full-time plus 1/3 part time) to full-time
equivalent instructional faculty (full time plus 1/3 part time). In the ratio calculations, exclude both
faculty and students in stand-alone graduate or professional programs such as medicine, law,
veterinary, dentistry, social work, business, or public health in which faculty teach virtually only
graduate level students. Do not count undergraduate or graduate student teaching assistants as faculty.

faculty).

I-3. Undergraduate Class Size

In the table below, please use the following definitions to report information about the size of classes
and class sections offered in the Fall 2022 term.

Please include classes that have been moved online in response to the COVID-19 pandemic..

Class Sections: A class section is an organized course offered for credit, identified by discipline and
number, meeting at a stated time or times in a classroom or similar setting, and not a subsection such
as a laboratory or discussion session. Undergraduate class sections are defined as any sections in which
at least one degree-seeking undergraduate student is enrolled for credit. Exclude distance learning
classes and noncredit classes and individual instruction such as dissertation or thesis research, music
instruction, or one-to-one readings. Exclude students in independent study, co-operative programs,
internships, foreign language taped tutor sessions, practicums, and all students in one-on-one classes.
Each class section should be counted only once and should not be duplicated because of course catalog
cross-listings.

Class Subsections: A class subsection includes any subsection of a course, such as laboratory,
recitation, and discussion subsections that are supplementary in nature and are scheduled to meet
separately from the lecture portion of the course. Undergraduate subsections are defined as any
subsections of courses in which degree-seeking undergraduate students enrolled for credit. As above,
exclude noncredit classes and individual instruction such as dissertation or thesis research, music

                                                                                                 P a g e | 32



instruction, or one-to-one readings. Each class subsection should be counted only once and should not
be duplicated because of cross-listings.

Using the above definitions, please report for each of the following class-size intervals the number of
class sections and class subsections offered in Fall 2022. For example, a lecture class with 800 students
who met at another time in 40 separate labs with 20 students should be counted once in the “100+”
column in the class section column and 40 times under the “20-29” column of the class subsections
table.

J. DEGREES CONFERRED

Degrees conferred between July 1, 2021 and June 30, 2022

For each of the following discipline areas, provide the percentage of diplomas/certificates, associate, and
bachelor’s degrees awarded. To determine the percentage, use majors, not headcount (e.g., students
with one degree but a double major will be represented twice). Calculate the percentage from your
institution’s IPEDS Completions by using the sum of 1st and 2nd majors for each CIP code as the
numerator and the sum of the Grand Total by 1st Majors and the Grand Total by 2nd major as the
denominator. If you prefer, you can compute the percentages using 1st majors only.

                                                                                            P a g e | 33

Financial Aid Definitions

Awarded aid: The dollar amounts offered to financial aid applicants.

External scholarships and grants: Scholarships and grants received from outside (private) sources that
students bring with them (e.g., Kiwanis, National Merit scholarships). The institution may process
paperwork to receive the dollars, but it has no role in determining the recipient or the dollar amount
awarded.

Financial aid applicant: Any applicant who submits any one of the institutionally required financial aid
applications/forms, such as the FAFSA.

Indebtedness: Aggregate dollar amount borrowed through any loan program (federal, state, subsidized,
unsubsidized, private, etc.; excluding parent loans) while the student was enrolled at an institution.
Student loans co-signed by a parent are assumed to be the responsibility of the student and should be
included.

Institutional scholarships and grants: Endowed scholarships, annual gifts and tuition funded grants
for which the institution determines the recipient.

Financial need: As determined by your institution using the federal methodology and/or your institution's
own standards.

Need-based aid: College-funded or college-administered award from institutional, state, federal, or other
sources for which a student must have financial need to qualify. This includes both institutional and non-
institutional student aid (grants, jobs, and loans).

Need-based scholarship or grant aid: Scholarships and grants from institutional, state, federal, or
other sources for which a student must have financial need to qualify.

Need-based self-help aid: Loans and jobs from institutional, state, federal, or other sources for which
a student must demonstrate financial need to qualify.

Non-need-based scholarship or grant aid: Scholarships and grants, gifts, or merit-based aid from
institutional, state, federal, or other sources (including unrestricted funds or gifts and endowment income)
awarded solely on the basis of academic achievement, merit, or any other non-need-based reason. When
reporting questions H1 and H2, non-need-based aid that is used to meet need should be counted as need-
based aid.

   Note: Suggested order of precedence for counting non-need money as need-based:

             1.   Non-need institutional grants                       6.   Non-need outside grants
             2.   Non-need tuition waivers                            7.   Non-need student loans
             3.   Non-need athletic awards                            8.   Non-need parent loans
             4.   Non-need federal grants                             9.   Non-need work
             5.   Non-need state grants

Non-need-based self-help aid: Loans and jobs from institutional, state, or other sources for which a
student need not demonstrate financial need to qualify.

Private student loans: A nonfederal loan made by a lender such as a bank, credit union or private lender
used to pay for up to the annual cost of education, less any financial aid received.

External scholarships and grants: Scholarships and grants received from outside (private) sources
that students bring with them (e.g., Kiwanis, National Merit scholarships). The institution may process
paperwork to receive the dollars, but it has no role in determining the recipient or the dollar amount
awarded.

Work study and employment: Federal and state work study aid, and any employment packaged by
your institution in financial aid awards.
