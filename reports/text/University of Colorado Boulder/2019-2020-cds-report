Graduation Rates

The items in this section correspond to data elements collected by the IPEDS Web-based Data Collection System’s Graduation Rate
Survey (GRS). For complete instructions and definitions of data elements, see the IPEDS GRS Forms and Instructions for the 2019-
20 Survey.
In the following section for bachelor’s or equivalent programs, please disaggregate the Fall 2012 and Fall 2013 cohorts (formerly
CDS B4-B11) into four groups:
   •   Students who received a Federal Pell Grant*
   •   Recipients of a subsidized Stafford Loan who did not receive a Pell Grant
   •   Students who did not receive either a Pell Grant or a subsidized Stafford Loan
   •   Total (all students, regardless of Pell Grant or subsidized loan status)
*Students who received both a Federal Pell Grant and a subsidized Stafford Loan should be reported in the "Recipients of a Federal
Pell Grant" column.

For each graduation rate grid below, the numbers in the first three columns for Questions A-G should sum to the cohort total in the
fourth column (formerly CDS B4-B11).

Provide information for ALL enrolled, degree-seeking, full-time and part-time, first-time, first-year (freshman) students enrolled
in Fall 2019, including students who began studies during summer, international students/nonresident aliens, and students admitted
under special arrangements.

C9. Percent and number of first-time, first-year (freshman) students enrolled in Fall 2019 who submitted national
standardized (SAT/ACT) test scores. Include information for ALL enrolled, degree-seeking, first-time, first-year (freshman)
students who submitted test scores. Do not include partial test scores (e.g., mathematics scores but not critical reading for a
category of students) or combine other standardized test results (such as TOEFL) in this item. Do not convert SAT scores to ACT
scores and vice versa.

If a student submitted multiple sets of scores for a single test, report this information according to how you use the data.
For example:
     • If you consider the highest scores from either submission, use the highest combination of scores (e.g., verbal from one
        submission, math from the other).
     • If you average the scores, use the average to report the scores.

G1.Undergraduate full-time tuition, required fees, room and board
   List the typical tuition, required fees, and room and board for a full-time undergraduate student for the FULL 2020-2021 academic
   year (30 semester hours or 45 quarter hours for institutions that derive annual tuition by multiplying credit hour cost by number of
   credits). A full academic year refers to the period of time generally extending from September to June; usually equated to two
   semesters, two trimesters, three quarters, or the period covered by a four-one-four plan. Room and board is defined as double
   occupancy and 19 meals per week or the maximum meal plan. Required fees include only charges that all full-time students
   must pay that are not included in tuition (e.g., registration, health, or activity fees.) Do not include optional fees (e.g., parking,
   laboratory use).

                                                        H. FINANCIAL AID

Please refer to the following financial aid definitions when completing Section H.

Awarded aid: The dollar amounts offered to financial aid applicants.

Financial aid applicant: Any applicant who submits any one of the institutionally required financial aid applications/forms, such as
the FAFSA.

Indebtedness: Aggregate dollar amount borrowed through any loan program (federal, state, subsidized, unsubsidized, private, etc.;
excluding parent loans) while the student was enrolled at an institution. Student loans co-signed by a parent are assumed to be the
responsibility of the student and should be included.

Institutional scholarships and grants: Endowed scholarships, annual gifts and tuition funded grants for which the institution
determines the recipient.

Financial need: As determined by your institution using the federal methodology and/or your institution's own standards.

Need-based aid: College-funded or college-administered award from institutional, state, federal, or other sources for which a student
must have financial need to qualify. This includes both institutional and non-institutional student aid (grants, jobs, and loans).

Need-based scholarship or grant aid: Scholarships and grants from institutional, state, federal, or other sources for which a
student must have financial need to qualify.

Need-based self-help aid: Loans and jobs from institutional, state, federal, or other sources for which a student must demonstrate
financial need to qualify.

Non-need-based scholarship or grant aid: Scholarships and grants, gifts, or merit-based aid from institutional, state, federal, or
other sources (including unrestricted funds or gifts and endowment income) awarded solely on the basis of academic achievement,
merit, or any other non-need-based reason. When reporting questions H1 and H2, non-need-based aid that is used to meet need
should be counted as need-based aid.

   Note: Suggested order of precedence for counting non-need money as need-based:
   Non-need institutional grants
   Non-need tuition waivers
   Non-need athletic awards

                                                    Common Data Set 2019-2020



   Non-need federal grants
   Non-need state grants
   Non-need outside grants
   Non-need student loans
   Non-need parent loans
   Non-need work

Non-need-based self-help aid: Loans and jobs from institutional, state, or other sources for which a student need not demonstrate
financial need to qualify.

Private student loans: A nonfederal loan made by a lender such as a bank, credit union or private lender used to pay for up to the
annual cost of education, less any financial aid received.

External scholarships and grants: Scholarships and grants received from outside (private) sources that students bring with them
(e.g., Kiwanis, National Merit scholarships). The institution may process paperwork to receive the dollars, but it has no role in
determining the recipient or the dollar amount awarded.

Work study and employment: Federal and state work study aid, and any employment packaged by your institution in financial aid
awards.

Aid Awarded to Enrolled Undergraduates

H1. Enter total dollar amounts awarded to enrolled full-time and less than full-time degree-seeking undergraduates (using the same
   cohort reported in CDS Question B1, “total degree-seeking” undergraduates) in the following categories. (Note: If the data
   being reported are final figures for the 2018-2019 academic year (see the next item below), use the 2018-2019 academic year's
   CDS Question B1 cohort.) Include aid awarded to international students (i.e., those not qualifying for federal aid). Aid that is
   non-need-based but that was used to meet need should be reported in the need-based aid column. (For a suggested
   order of precedence in assigning categories of aid to cover need, see the entry for “non-need-based scholarship or
   grant aid” on the last page of the definitions section.)

   Indicate the academic year for which data are reported for items H1, H2, H2A, and H6 below:

faculty whose highest degree is a doctorate or other terminal degree is 87%.

I-2. Student to Faculty Ratio

Report the Fall 2019 ratio of full-time equivalent students (full-time plus 1/3 part time) to full-time equivalent instructional faculty (full
time plus 1/3 part time). In the ratio calculations, exclude both faculty and students in stand-alone graduate or professional programs
such as medicine, law, veterinary, dentistry, social work, business, or public health in which faculty teach virtually only graduate level
students. Do not count undergraduate or graduate student teaching assistants as faculty.

Fall 2019 Student to Faculty ratio: __17.7__ to 1
(based on 33,136 student FTE and 1,877 faculty FTE [from 37,907 undergraduate and graduate students excluding law and
telecommunications and 2,382 instructional faculty excluding law and telecommunications]).

I-3. Undergraduate Class Size

In the table below, please use the following definitions to report information about the size of classes and class sections offered in the
Fall 2019 term.

Class Sections: A class section is an organized course offered for credit, identified by discipline and number, meeting at a stated
time or times in a classroom or similar setting, and not a subsection such as a laboratory or discussion session. Undergraduate class
sections are defined as any sections in which at least one degree-seeking undergraduate student is enrolled for credit. Exclude
distance learning classes and noncredit classes and individual instruction such as dissertation or thesis research, music instruction,
or one-to-one readings. Exclude students in independent study, co-operative programs, internships, foreign language taped tutor
sessions, practicums, and all students in one-on-one classes. Each class section should be counted only once and should not be
duplicated because of course catalog cross-listings.

Class Subsections: A class subsection includes any subsection of a course, such as laboratory, recitation, and discussion
subsections that are supplementary in nature and are scheduled to meet separately from the lecture portion of the course.
Undergraduate subsections are defined as any subsections of courses in which degree-seeking undergraduate students enrolled for
credit. As above, exclude noncredit classes and individual instruction such as dissertation or thesis research, music instruction, or
one-to-one readings. Each class subsection should be counted only once and should not be duplicated because of cross-listings.

Using the above definitions, please report for each of the following class-size intervals the number of class sections and class
subsections offered in Fall 2019. For example, a lecture class with 800 students who met at another time in 40 separate labs with 20
students should be counted once in the “100+” column in the class section column and 40 times under the “20-29” column of the
class subsections table.

                                     J. Disciplinary areas of DEGREES CONFERRED

Degrees conferred between July 1, 2018 and June 30, 2019

For each of the following discipline areas, provide the percentage of diplomas/certificates, associate, and bachelor’s degrees
awarded. To determine the percentage, use majors, not headcount (e.g., students with one degree but a double major will be
represented twice). Calculate the percentage from your institution’s IPEDS Completions by using the sum of 1st and 2nd majors for
each CIP code as the numerator and the sum of the Grand Total by 1st Majors and the Grand Total by 2nd major as the denominator.
If you prefer, you can compute the percentages using 1st majors only.

Bachelor's Degrees Awarded--includes double and second majors

External scholarships and grants: Scholarships and grants received from outside (private) sources that students bring with them (e.g., Kiwanis,
National Merit scholarships). The institution may process paperwork to receive the dollars, but it has no role in determining the recipient or the
dollar amount awarded.

recipient.

Financial need: As determined by your institution using the federal methodology and/or your institution's own standards.

(including unrestricted funds or gifts and endowment income) awarded solely on the basis of academic achievement, merit, or any other non-need-
based reason. When reporting questions H1 and H2, non-need-based aid that is used to meet need should be counted as need-based aid.

    Note: Suggested order of precedence for counting non-need money as need-based:
    Non-need institutional grants
    Non-need tuition waivers
    Non-need athletic awards
    Non-need federal grants
    Non-need state grants
    Non-need outside grants
