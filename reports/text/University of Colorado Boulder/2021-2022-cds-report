B4-B21: Graduation Rates

The items in this section correspond to data elements collected by the IPEDS Web-based Data Collection
System’s Graduation Rate Survey (GRS). For complete instructions and definitions of data elements, see the
IPEDS GRS Forms and Instructions for the 2019-20 Survey.
In the following section for bachelor’s or equivalent programs, please disaggregate the Fall 2013 and Fall 2014
cohorts (formerly CDS B4-B11) into four groups:
   •   Students who received a Federal Pell Grant*
   •   Recipients of a subsidized Stafford Loan who did not receive a Pell Grant
   •   Students who did not receive either a Pell Grant or a subsidized Stafford Loan
   •   Total (all students, regardless of Pell Grant or subsidized loan status)
*Students who received both a Federal Pell Grant and a subsidized Stafford Loan should be reported in the
"Recipients of a Federal Pell Grant" column.

For each graduation rate grid below, the numbers in the first three columns for Questions A-G should sum to
the cohort total in the fourth column (formerly CDS B4-B11).

C9-C12: Freshman Profile

Provide information for ALL enrolled, degree-seeking, full-time and part-time, first-time, first-year
(freshman) students enrolled in Fall 2021, including students who began studies during summer, international
students/nonresident aliens, and students admitted under special arrangements.

C9. Percent and number of first-time, first-year (freshman) students enrolled in Fall 2021 who
submitted national standardized (SAT/ACT) test scores. Include information for ALL enrolled, degree-
seeking, first-time, first-year (freshman) students who submitted test scores. Do not include partial test
scores (e.g., mathematics scores but not critical reading for a category of students) or combine other
standardized test results (such as TOEFL) in this item. Do not convert SAT scores to ACT scores and vice
versa.

If a student submitted multiple sets of scores for a single test, report this information according to how
you use the data. For example:
     • If you consider the highest scores from either submission, use the highest combination of scores (e.g.,
        verbal from one submission, math from the other).
     • If you average the scores, use the average to report the scores.

   List the typical tuition, required fees, and room and board for a full-time undergraduate student for the
   FULL 2022-2023 academic year (30 semester hours or 45 quarter hours for institutions that derive annual
   tuition by multiplying credit hour cost by number of credits). A full academic year refers to the period of time
   generally extending from September to June; usually equated to two semesters, two trimesters, three
   quarters, or the period covered by a four-one-four plan. Room and board is defined as double occupancy
   and 19 meals per week or the maximum meal plan. Required fees include only charges that all full-time
   students must pay that are not included in tuition (e.g., registration, health, or activity fees.) Do not include
   optional fees (e.g., parking, laboratory use).

H. FINANCIAL AID

Please refer to the following financial aid definitions when completing Section H.

Awarded aid: The dollar amounts offered to financial aid applicants.

Financial aid applicant: Any applicant who submits any one of the institutionally required financial aid
applications/forms, such as the FAFSA.

Indebtedness: Aggregate dollar amount borrowed through any loan program (federal, state, subsidized,
unsubsidized, private, etc.; excluding parent loans) while the student was enrolled at an institution. Student
loans co-signed by a parent are assumed to be the responsibility of the student and should be included.

Institutional scholarships and grants: Endowed scholarships, annual gifts and tuition funded grants for
which the institution determines the recipient.

Financial need: As determined by your institution using the federal methodology and/or your institution's own
standards.

Need-based aid: College-funded or college-administered award from institutional, state, federal, or other
sources for which a student must have financial need to qualify. This includes both institutional and non-
institutional student aid (grants, jobs, and loans).

Need-based scholarship or grant aid: Scholarships and grants from institutional, state, federal, or other
sources for which a student must have financial need to qualify.

Need-based self-help aid: Loans and jobs from institutional, state, federal, or other sources for which a
student must demonstrate financial need to qualify.

Non-need-based scholarship or grant aid: Scholarships and grants, gifts, or merit-based aid from
institutional, state, federal, or other sources (including unrestricted funds or gifts and endowment income)
awarded solely on the basis of academic achievement, merit, or any other non-need-based reason. When
reporting questions H1 and H2, non-need-based aid that is used to meet need should be counted as need-
based aid.

   Note: Suggested order of precedence for counting non-need money as need-based:
   Non-need institutional grants
   Non-need tuition waivers
   Non-need athletic awards
   Non-need federal grants
   Non-need state grants
   Non-need outside grants
   Non-need student loans
   Non-need parent loans
   Non-need work

Non-need-based self-help aid: Loans and jobs from institutional, state, or other sources for which a student
need not demonstrate financial need to qualify.

                                          Common Data Set 2021-2022
Private student loans: A nonfederal loan made by a lender such as a bank, credit union or private lender
used to pay for up to the annual cost of education, less any financial aid received.

External scholarships and grants: Scholarships and grants received from outside (private) sources that
students bring with them (e.g., Kiwanis, National Merit scholarships). The institution may process paperwork to
receive the dollars, but it has no role in determining the recipient or the dollar amount awarded.

Work study and employment: Federal and state work study aid, and any employment packaged by your
institution in financial aid awards.

Do NOT include any aid related to the CARES Act or unique the COVID-19 pandemic

I-3. Undergraduate Class Size

In the table below, please use the following definitions to report information about the size of classes and class
sections offered in the Fall 2021 term.

    Please include classes that have been moved online in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Class Sections: A class section is an organized course offered for credit, identified by discipline and number,
meeting at a stated time or times in a classroom or similar setting, and not a subsection such as a laboratory or
discussion session. Undergraduate class sections are defined as any sections in which at least one degree-
seeking undergraduate student is enrolled for credit. Exclude distance learning classes and noncredit classes
and individual instruction such as dissertation or thesis research, music instruction, or one-to-one readings.
Exclude students in independent study, co-operative programs, internships, foreign language taped tutor
sessions, practicums, and all students in one-on-one classes. Each class section should be counted only once
and should not be duplicated because of course catalog cross-listings.

Class Subsections: A class subsection includes any subsection of a course, such as laboratory, recitation,
and discussion subsections that are supplementary in nature and are scheduled to meet separately from the
lecture portion of the course. Undergraduate subsections are defined as any subsections of courses in which
degree-seeking undergraduate students enrolled for credit. As above, exclude noncredit classes and individual
instruction such as dissertation or thesis research, music instruction, or one-to-one readings. Each class
subsection should be counted only once and should not be duplicated because of cross-listings.

Using the above definitions, please report for each of the following class-size intervals the number of class
sections and class subsections offered in Fall 2021. For example, a lecture class with 800 students who met at

section column and 40 times under the “20-29” column of the class subsections table.

NOTE: In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, in fall 2021 the University of Colorado Boulder offered a
mix of in-person, online, remote, and hybrid courses. The fall 2021 class section and subsection
counts report classes conducted in person; classes conducted via hybrid instruction, i.e., combining
traditional face-to-face instruction with web-based online learning; and courses that are meeting
exclusively remote. We do not include online courses, as these were courses that were online before
fall 2021.

                          J. Disciplinary areas of DEGREES CONFERRED

Degrees conferred between July 1, 2020 and June 30, 2021

For each of the following discipline areas, provide the percentage of diplomas/certificates, associate, and
bachelor’s degrees awarded. To determine the percentage, use majors, not headcount (e.g., students with one
degree but a double major will be represented twice). Calculate the percentage from your institution’s IPEDS
Completions by using the sum of 1st and 2nd majors for each CIP code as the numerator and the sum of the
Grand Total by 1st Majors and the Grand Total by 2nd major as the denominator. If you prefer, you can
compute the percentages using 1st majors only.

Bachelor's Degrees Awarded--includes double and second majors

External scholarships and grants: Scholarships and grants received from outside (private) sources that students bring
with them (e.g., Kiwanis, National Merit scholarships). The institution may process paperwork to receive the dollars, but it

applications/forms, such as the FAFSA.

Indebtedness: Aggregate dollar amount borrowed through any loan program (federal, state, subsidized, unsubsidized,

institution determines the recipient.

Financial need: As determined by your institution using the federal methodology and/or your institution's own standards.
