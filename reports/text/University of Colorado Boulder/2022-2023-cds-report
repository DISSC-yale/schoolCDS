B2. Enrollment by Racial/Ethnic Category. Provide numbers of undergraduate students for each of the
following categories as of the institution’s official fall reporting date or as of October 15, 2022. Include
international students only in the category "Nonresidents." Complete the “Total Undergraduates” column only if
you cannot provide data for the first two columns. Report as your institution reports to IPEDS: persons who are
Hispanic should be reported only on the Hispanic line, not under any race, and persons who are non-Hispanic
multi-racial should be reported only under "Two or more races."

New guidance from IPEDS for reporting aggregate data:
Racial/ethnic designations are requested only for United States citizens, residents, and other eligible non-
citizens. Eligible non-citizens include all students who completed high school or a GED equivalency within the
United States (including DACA and undocumented students) and who were not on an F-1 non-immigrant
student visa at the time of high school graduation.

More information about other eligible (for financial aid purposes) non-citizens is available at
https://studentaid.gov/understandaid/eligibility/requirements/non-us-citizens.

Nonresident – A person who is not a citizen or national of the United States and who is in this country on a
student visa or temporary basis and does not have the right to remain indefinitely. Do not include DACA,
undocumented, or other eligible noncitizens in this category.

NOTE - Nonresidents are to be reported separately, in the boxes provided, rather than included in any of the
seven racial/ethnic categories or in race/ethnicity unknown.

B4-B21: Graduation Rates

The items in this section correspond to data elements collected by the IPEDS Web-based Data Collection
System’s Graduation Rate Survey (GRS). For complete instructions and definitions of data elements, see the
IPEDS GRS Forms and Instructions for the 2022-23 Survey.
In the following section for bachelor’s or equivalent programs, please disaggregate the Fall 2014 and
Fall 2015 cohorts (formerly CDS B4-B11) into four groups:
   •   Students who received a Federal Pell Grant*
   •   Recipients of a subsidized Stafford Loan who did not receive a Pell Grant
   •   Students who did not receive either a Pell Grant or a subsidized Stafford Loan
   •   Total (all students, regardless of Pell Grant or subsidized loan status)
*Students who received both a Federal Pell Grant and a subsidized Stafford Loan should be reported in the
"Recipients of a Federal Pell Grant" column.

For each graduation rate grid below, the numbers in the first three columns for Questions A-G should sum to
the cohort total in the fourth column (formerly CDS B4-B11).

B22. Retention Rates
Report for the cohort of all full-time, first-time bachelor’s (or equivalent) degree-seeking undergraduate
students who entered in Fall 2021 (or the preceding summer term).

The initial cohort may be adjusted for students who departed for the following reasons:
    • Death
    • Permanent Disability
    • Service in the armed forces
    • Foreign aid service of the federal government
    • Official church missions
    • No other adjustments to the initial cohort should be made.

For the cohort of all full-time bachelor’s (or equivalent) degree-seeking undergraduate students who
      entered your institution as first-year students in Fall 2021 (or the preceding summer term), what
      percentage was enrolled at your institution as of the date your institution calculates its official
      enrollment in Fall 2022? __88%__

C1. First-time, first-year students: Provide the number of degree-seeking, first-time, first-year students who
    applied, were admitted, and enrolled (full- or part-time) in Fall 2022.
    • Include early decision, early action, and students who began studies during summer in this cohort.
    • Applicants should include only those students who fulfilled the requirements for consideration for
        admission (i.e., who completed actionable applications) and who have been notified of one of the
        following actions: admission, non-admission, placement on waiting list, or application withdrawn (by
        applicant or institution).
    • Admitted applicants should include wait-listed students who were subsequently offered admission.
    • Since the total may include students who did not provide gender data, the detail may not sum to the
        total.
    • If your institution collects and reports non-binary gender data, please use the “Another Gender”
        category.
    • Note that recent high school graduates and other students without prior postsecondary experience will
        still be considered “first-time students” for fall enrollment reporting purposes even if they enrolled in the
        summer prior to fall enrollment.

C9-C12: First-time, first-year Profile

Provide information for ALL enrolled, degree-seeking, full-time and part-time, first-time, first-year
students enrolled in Fall 2022, including students who began studies during summer, international
students/nonresidents, and students admitted under special arrangements.

C9. Percent and number of first-time, first-year students enrolled in Fall 2022 who submitted national
standardized (SAT/ACT) test scores. Include information for ALL enrolled, degree-seeking, first-time,
first-year students who submitted test scores. Do not include partial test scores (e.g., mathematics scores
but not critical reading for a category of students) or combine other standardized test results (such as TOEFL)
in this item. Do not convert SAT scores to ACT scores and vice versa.

If a student submitted multiple sets of scores for a single test, report this information according to how
you use the data. For example:
     • If you consider the highest scores from either submission, use the highest combination of scores (e.g.,
        verbal from one submission, math from the other).
     • If you average the scores, use the average to report the scores.

sources for which a student must have financial need to qualify. This includes both institutional and non-
institutional student aid (grants, jobs, and loans).

Need-based scholarship or grant aid: Scholarships and grants from institutional, state, federal, or other
sources for which a student must have financial need to qualify.

Need-based self-help aid: Loans and jobs from institutional, state, federal, or other sources for which a
student must demonstrate financial need to qualify.

Non-need-based scholarship or grant aid: Scholarships and grants, gifts, or merit-based aid from
institutional, state, federal, or other sources (including unrestricted funds or gifts and endowment income)
awarded solely on the basis of academic achievement, merit, or any other non-need-based reason. When
reporting questions H1 and H2, non-need-based aid that is used to meet need should be counted as need-
based aid.

   Note: Suggested order of precedence for counting non-need money as need-based:
   Non-need institutional grants
   Non-need tuition waivers
   Non-need athletic awards
   Non-need federal grants
   Non-need state grants
   Non-need outside grants
   Non-need student loans
   Non-need parent loans
   Non-need work

Non-need-based self-help aid: Loans and jobs from institutional, state, or other sources for which a student
need not demonstrate financial need to qualify.

Private student loans: A nonfederal loan made by a lender such as a bank, credit union or private lender
used to pay for up to the annual cost of education, less any financial aid received.

                                          Common Data Set 2022-2023
External scholarships and grants: Scholarships and grants received from outside (private) sources that
students bring with them (e.g., Kiwanis, National Merit scholarships). The institution may process paperwork to
receive the dollars, but it has no role in determining the recipient or the dollar amount awarded.

Work study and employment: Federal and state work study aid, and any employment packaged by your
institution in financial aid awards.

Do NOT include any aid related to the CARES Act or unique the COVID-19 pandemic

Aid Awarded to Enrolled Undergraduates

H1. Enter total dollar amounts awarded to enrolled full-time and less than full-time degree-seeking

I-2. Student to Faculty Ratio

Report the Fall 2022 ratio of full-time equivalent students (full-time plus 1/3 part time) to full-time equivalent
instructional faculty (full time plus 1/3 part time). In the ratio calculations, exclude both faculty and students in
stand-alone graduate or professional programs such as medicine, law, veterinary, dentistry, social work,
business, or public health in which faculty teach virtually only graduate level students. Do not count
undergraduate or graduate student teaching assistants as faculty.

Fall 2022 Student to Faculty ratio: __18.3__ to 1
Based on 33,841 student FTE and 1,852 faculty FTE (from 39,670 undergraduate and graduate students
excluding law and telecommunications and 2,316 instructional faculty excluding law and telecommunications).

                                           Common Data Set 2022-2023

I-3. Undergraduate Class Size

In the table below, please use the following definitions to report information about the size of classes and class
sections offered in the Fall 2022 term.

    Please include classes that have been moved online in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Class Sections: A class section is an organized course offered for credit, identified by discipline and number,
meeting at a stated time or times in a classroom or similar setting, and not a subsection such as a laboratory or
discussion session. Undergraduate class sections are defined as any sections in which at least one degree-
seeking undergraduate student is enrolled for credit. Exclude distance learning classes and noncredit classes
and individual instruction such as dissertation or thesis research, music instruction, or one-to-one readings.
Exclude students in independent study, co-operative programs, internships, foreign language taped tutor
sessions, practicums, and all students in one-on-one classes. Each class section should be counted only once
and should not be duplicated because of course catalog cross-listings.

Class Subsections: A class subsection includes any subsection of a course, such as laboratory, recitation,
and discussion subsections that are supplementary in nature and are scheduled to meet separately from the
lecture portion of the course. Undergraduate subsections are defined as any subsections of courses in which
degree-seeking undergraduate students enrolled for credit. As above, exclude noncredit classes and individual
instruction such as dissertation or thesis research, music instruction, or one-to-one readings. Each class
subsection should be counted only once and should not be duplicated because of cross-listings.

Using the above definitions, please report for each of the following class-size intervals the number of class
sections and class subsections offered in Fall 2022. For example, a lecture class with 800 students who met at
another time in 40 separate labs with 20 students should be counted once in the “100+” column in the class
section column and 40 times under the “20-29” column of the class subsections table.

NOTE: In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, in Fall 2022 the University of Colorado Boulder offered
a mix of in-person, online, remote, and hybrid courses. The Fall 2022 class section and subsection
counts report classes conducted in person; classes conducted via hybrid instruction, i.e., combining
traditional face-to-face instruction with web-based online learning; and courses that are meeting
exclusively remote. We do not include online courses, as these were courses that were online before
Fall 2022.

                            J. Disciplinary areas of DEGREES CONFERRED

Degrees conferred between July 1, 2021 and June 30, 2022

For each of the following discipline areas, provide the percentage of diplomas/certificates, associate, and
bachelor’s degrees awarded. To determine the percentage, use majors, not headcount (e.g., students with one
degree but a double major will be represented twice). Calculate the percentage from your institution’s IPEDS
Completions by using the sum of 1st and 2nd majors for each CIP code as the numerator and the sum of the
Grand Total by 1st Majors and the Grand Total by 2nd major as the denominator. If you prefer, you can
compute the percentages using 1st majors only.

                                              Financial Aid Definitions


External scholarships and grants: Scholarships and grants received from outside (private) sources that students bring
with them (e.g., Kiwanis, National Merit scholarships). The institution may process paperwork to receive the dollars, but it
has no role in determining the recipient or the dollar amount awarded.

Financial aid applicant: Any applicant who submits any one of the institutionally required financial aid
applications/forms, such as the FAFSA.

Indebtedness: Aggregate dollar amount borrowed through any loan program (federal, state, subsidized, unsubsidized,
private, etc.; excluding parent loans) while the student was enrolled at an institution. Student loans co-signed by a parent
are assumed to be the responsibility of the student and should be included.

Institutional scholarships and grants: Endowed scholarships, annual gifts and tuition funded grants for which the
institution determines the recipient.

Financial need: As determined by your institution using the federal methodology and/or your institution's own standards.

Need-based aid: College-funded or college-administered award from institutional, state, federal, or other sources for
which a student must have financial need to qualify. This includes both institutional and non-institutional student aid
(grants, jobs, and loans).

Need-based scholarship or grant aid: Scholarships and grants from institutional, state, federal, or other sources for
which a student must have financial need to qualify.

Need-based self-help aid: Loans and jobs from institutional, state, federal, or other sources for which a student must
demonstrate financial need to qualify.

Non-need-based scholarship or grant aid: Scholarships and grants, gifts, or merit-based aid from institutional, state,
federal, or other sources (including unrestricted funds or gifts and endowment income) awarded solely on the basis of
academic achievement, merit, or any other non-need-based reason. When reporting questions H1 and H2, non-need-
based aid that is used to meet need should be counted as need-based aid.

    Note: Suggested order of precedence for counting non-need money as need-based:
    Non-need institutional grants
    Non-need tuition waivers
    Non-need athletic awards
    Non-need federal grants
    Non-need state grants
    Non-need outside grants
    Non-need student loans
    Non-need parent loans
    Non-need work

Non-need-based self-help aid: Loans and jobs from institutional, state, or other sources for which a student need not
demonstrate financial need to qualify.

Work study and employment: Federal and state work study aid, and any employment packaged by your institution in
financial aid awards.
