    G1. Undergraduate full­time tuition, required fees, room and board

    List the typical tuition, required fees, and room and board for a full­time undergraduate student for the
    FULL 2017­2018 academic year (30 semester hours or 45 quarter hours for institutions that derive annual
    tuition by multiplying credit hour cost by number of credits). A full academic year refers to the period of
    time generally extending from September to June; usually equated to two semesters, two trimesters,
    three quarters, or the period covered by a four­one­four plan. Room and board is defined as double
    occupancy and 19 meals per week or the maximum meal plan. Required fees include only charges that
    all full­time students must pay that are not included in tuition (e.g., registration, health, or activity fees.)
    Do not include optional fees (e.g., parking, laboratory use).

    *The Office of Financial Aid took a closer look at all the components this year to make sure they were reflective of a realistic cost at
    CU­Boulder. They found that the previous off­campus housing rate for undergraduate students was lower than what many of our
    students are experiencing. They also found the medical component to be higher than our undergraduate students are paying. A
    small population of undergraduates enroll in the campus health insurance, which is what this component was there to cover. In
    addition, changes to medical coverage nationwide (such as students being able to remain on their parents' health insurance for a
    longer period of time) have had an impact. Consequently they removed this expense to reflect a more accurate budget for most CU­
    Boulder students.

    Undergraduate Cost of Attendance (Information not requested by CDS)

    Cost of attendance (COA) is an estimate of the amount it will cost a student to attend CU­Boulder for one
    academic year. COA includes: (1) direct education expenses (tuition, fees, books, and supplies) and (2)
    indirect education expenses (room, board, personal, medical, and transportation). COA is used in
    determining the amount of financial aid for which a student is eligible. Eligibility is a direct function of
    financial need, calculated as the difference between total COA and the expected family contribution.

    COA for first­year students living on campus:

     For in­state residents                                     $29,216
     For out of state                                           $53,486

     NOTE: The notes in H15 have been updated for 2016­17.

     H1. Enter total dollar amounts awarded to full­time and less than full­time degree­seeking
     undergraduates (using the same cohort reported in CDS Question B1, "total degree­seeking"
     undergraduates) in the following categories. (Note: If the data being reported are final figures for the
     2013­2014 academic year (see the next item below), use the 2013­2014 academic year's CDS Question
     B1 cohort.) Include aid awarded to international students (i.e., those not qualifying for federal aid). Aid
     that is non­need­based but that was used to meet need should be reported in the need­based aid
     columns. (For a suggested order of precedence in assigning categories of aid to cover need, see the
     entry for "non­need­based scholarship or grant aid" on the last page of the definitions section.)

     H15. If your institution has recently implemented any major financial aid policy, program, or initiative to
     make your institution more affordable to incoming students such as replacing loans with grants, or
     waiving costs for families below a certain income level, please provide details below.

       Colorado resident undergraduates

       In April 2016 the University of Colorado Board of Regents approved a four­year guarantee of tuition
       and mandatory fee costs for undergraduate resident students. The purpose of this guarantee is to
       provide financial predictability for students and families. The Guarantee program places each
       student within a cohort that is defined by the date of entry to the university. Each entering freshman
       class will see a one­time increase in tuition and mandatory fees with a lock on that tuition and fees
       for the next four years. The inaugural cohort comprises all resident undergraduate students –
       freshmen and transfers – who enrolled in Fall 2016.

       The CU Boulder Esteemed Scholars Program scholarship program recognizes top Colorado resident
       students for their outstanding academic achievements. These scholarships were first awarded in fall
       2013. Students applying as freshmen for the fall semester are automatically considered for the
       program upon submission of an admissions application to CU Boulder. Named for CU Boulder's first
       presidents, the scholarships include the President Joseph A. Sewall Award ($20,000, paid over 4
       years; $5,000 per year), the President Horace M. Hale Award ($14,000, paid over 4 years; $3,500
       per year), and the President James H. Baker Award ($10,000, paid over 4 years; $2,500 per year).
       The program is merit based; scholarships will be awarded to a select group of entering Colorado
       resident freshman students based on a combination of grade point average and ACT or SAT test
       scores.

       In response to the White House initiative to expand college opportunities for American students, the
       CU Boulder campus has committed to expanding the CU Promise program to include all Pell eligible
       students beginning in the fall of 2014. Eligible CU Boulder students who enter as a new freshman or
       transfer student are awarded grants plus a work­study award to cover the cost of tuition, required
       fees and estimated books. We anticipate 550 to 600 new students in this program.

       To maintain accessibility, CU Boulder has several financial aid programs for resident
       undergraduates. These programs are for Boulder campus degree­seeking and teacher licensure
       students. They are based on credits taken on the main campus only; continuing education hours are
       not included.

       The CU Boulder Transfer Excellence Scholarship will be awarded beginning Fall 2017 to
       undergraduate resident and out­of­state students transferring to CU Boulder with a cumulative
       college GPA of 3.75 or better and who have completed a minimum of 12 credit hours of college
       course work after high school graduation (or equivalent). Amount of the award is $6,000 per year for
       out­of­state students and $3,000 per year for in­state students.

       Out­of­state undergraduates

       Tuition rates for undergraduates not classified as Colorado residents for tuition purposes have been
       covered by the non­resident undergraduate tuition guarantee program since 2005­06. Click here for
       details of the non­resident undergraduate tuition guarantee.

       The Chancellor's Achievement Scholarship (introduced in 2005­06) offers $25,000 over four years to
       the top 25% of out­of­state admitted new freshmen.

       Presidential Scholars are a select group drawn from Chancellor's Achievement Scholars.
       Presidential Scholars receive $55,000 over four years. These select students are awarded $15,000
       per year during their freshman and sophomore years and $12,500 per year during their junior and
       senior years. The Presidential Scholars program began in 2006­07.

       The CU Boulder Transfer Excellence Scholarship will be awarded beginning Fall 2017 to
       undergraduate resident and out­of­state students transferring to CU Boulder with a cumulative
       college GPA of 3.75 or better and who have completed a minimum of 12 credit hours of college

     equivalent instructional faculty (full time plus 1/3 part time). In the ratio calculations, exclude both faculty
     and students in stand­alone graduate or professional programs such as medicine, law, veterinary,
     dentistry, social work, business, or public health in which faculty teach virtually only graduate level
     students. Do not count undergraduate or graduate student teaching assistants as faculty.

     Undergraduate Class Size

     I3. In the table below, please use the following definitions to report information about the size of classes
     and class sections offered in the Fall 2016 term.

     Class Sections: A class section is an organized course offered for credit, identified by discipline and
     number, meeting at a stated time or times in a classroom or similar setting, and not a subsection such
     as a laboratory or discussion session. Undergraduate class sections are defined as any sections in
     which at least one degree­seeking undergraduate student is enrolled for credit. Exclude distance learning
     classes and noncredit classes and individual instruction such as dissertation or thesis research, music
     instruction, or one­to­one readings. Exclude students in independent study, co­operative programs,
     internships, foreign language taped tutor sessions, practicums, and all students in one­on­one classes.
     Each class section should be counted only once and should not be duplicated because of course catalog
     cross­listings.

     Class Subsections: A class subsection includes any subsection of a course, such as laboratory,
     recitation, and discussion subsections that are supplementary in nature and are scheduled to meet
     separately from the lecture portion of the course. Undergraduate subsections are defined as any
     subsections of courses in which degree­seeking undergraduate students enrolled for credit. As above,
     exclude noncredit classes and individual instruction such as dissertation or thesis research, music
     instruction, or one­to­one readings. Each class subsection should be counted only once and should not
     be duplicated because of cross­listings.

     Using the above definitions, please report for each of the following class­size intervals the number of
     class sections and class subsections offered in Fall 2016 For example, a lecture class with 800
     students who met at another time in 40 separate labs with 20 students should be counted once in the
     "100+" column in the class section column and 40 times under the "20­29" column of the class
     subsections table.

    J. Degrees Conferred: Common Data Set 2016­17
    Degrees conferred between July 1, 2015 and June 30, 2016

    For each of the following discipline areas, provide the percentage of diplomas/certificates,
    associate, and bachelor's degrees awarded. To determine the percentage, use major, not headcount
    (e.g., students with one degree but a double major will be represented twice). Calculate the
    percentage from your institution's IPEDS Completions by using the sum of 1st and 2nd majors for
    each CIP code as the numerator and the sum of the Grand Total by 1st Majors and the Grand Total
    by 2nd major as the denominator. If you prefer, you can compute the percentages using 1st majors
    only.

    Undergraduate Degrees Only­­includes double and second majors
