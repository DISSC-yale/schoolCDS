Graduation Rates

The items in this section correspond to data elements collected by the IPEDS Web-based Data Collection System's
Graduation Rate Survey (GRS). For complete instructions and definitions of data elements, see the IPEDS GRS Forms
and Instructions for the 2017-18 Survey.

In the following section for bachelor’s or equivalent programs, please disaggregate the Fall 2010 and Fall 2011 cohorts
(formerly CDS B4-B11) into four groups:

       Students who received a Federal Pell Grant*
       Recipients of a subsidized Stafford Loan who did not receive a Pell Grant
       Students who did not receive either a Pell Grant or a subsidized Stafford Loan
       Total (all students, regardless of Pell Grant or subsidized loan status)

*Students who received both a Federal Pell Grant and a subsidized Stafford Loan should be reported in the "Recipients
of a Federal Pell Grant" column.

For each graduation rate grid below, the numbers in the first three columns for Questions A-G should sum to the cohort
total in the fourth column (formerly CDS B4-B11). For each graduation rate grid below, the numbers in the first three
columns for Questions A-G should sum to the cohort total in the fourth column (formerly CDS B4-B11).

For Bachelor's or Equivalent Programs

Please provide data for the Fall 2011 cohort if available. If Fall 2011 cohort data are not available, provide data for the
Fall 2010 cohort.

Provide 2018-2019 academic year costs for the following categories that are applicable to your
institution.

NOTE: Expenses shown are for the 2017-18 academic year.

    Check here if your institution's 2018-2019 academic year costs are not available at this time and
provide an approximate date (i.e., month/day) when your institution's final 2018-2019 academic year costs
will be available: June 2018

G1. Undergraduate full-time tuition, required fees, room and board

List the typical tuition, required fees, and room and board for a full-time undergraduate student for the
FULL 2018-2019 academic year (30 semester hours or 45 quarter hours for institutions that derive annual
tuition by multiplying credit hour cost by number of credits). A full academic year refers to the period of
time generally extending from September to June; usually equated to two semesters, two trimesters, three
quarters, or the period covered by a four-one-four plan. Room and board is defined as double occupancy
and 19 meals per week or the maximum meal plan. Required fees include only charges that all full-time
students must pay that are not included in tuition (e.g., registration, health, or activity fees.) Do not include
optional fees (e.g., parking, laboratory use).

*CU Boulder has a four-year tuition guarantee program for resident and non-resident
undergraduates. With this guarantee, rates are held constant through the fourth summer from entry for all
students enrolled as degree-seeking undergraduates. For details, see
http://www.colorado.edu/bfp/budget/tuitionfees/guarantee.html. The amount listed is for undergraduates
entering in fall 2016.

*The Office of Financial Aid took a closer look at all the components this year to make sure they were reflective of a realistic cost at CU-
Boulder. They found that the previous off-campus housing rate for undergraduate students was lower than what many of our students are
experiencing. They also found the medical component to be higher than our undergraduate students are paying. A small population of
undergraduates enroll in the campus health insurance, which is what this component was there to cover. In addition, changes to medical
coverage nationwide (such as students being able to remain on their parents' health insurance for a longer period of time) have had an
impact. Consequently they removed this expense to reflect a more accurate budget for most CU-Boulder students.

Undergraduate Cost of Attendance (Information not requested by CDS)

Cost of attendance (COA) is an estimate of the amount it will cost a student to attend CU-Boulder for one
academic year. COA includes: (1) direct education expenses (tuition, fees, books, and supplies) and (2)
indirect education expenses (room, board, personal, medical, and transportation). COA is used in

determining the amount of financial aid for which a student is eligible. Eligibility is a direct function of
financial need, calculated as the difference between total COA and the expected family contribution.

COA for first-year students living on campus:

For in-state residents                            $30,178
For out of state                                  $54,974

Aid Awarded to Enrolled Undergraduates

NOTE: The notes in H15 have been updated for 2017-18.

H1. Enter total dollar amounts awarded to full-time and less than full-time degree-seeking
undergraduates (using the same cohort reported in CDS Question B1, "total degree-seeking"
undergraduates) in the following categories. (Note: If the data being reported are final figures for the
2013-2014 academic year (see the next item below), use the 2013-2014 academic year's CDS Question
B1 cohort.) Include aid awarded to international students (i.e., those not qualifying for federal aid). Aid
that is non-need-based but that was used to meet need should be reported in the need-based aid
columns. (For a suggested order of precedence in assigning categories of aid to cover need, see the
entry for "non-need-based scholarship or grant aid" on the last page of the definitions section.)

*The dramatic drop in this amount compared with prior years is due to removal of ROTC grants from federal aid calculations, based on
a 2009 change in law (see https://ifap.ed.gov/eannouncements/081309GuidFedVeteransEdBenefits.html. When the university belatedly

realized we had not been excluding this, we changed our business practice to not pull this waiver into the financial aid system anymore.

waiving costs for families below a certain income level, please provide details below.

 Colorado resident undergraduates

 In April 2016 the University of Colorado Board of Regents approved a four-year guarantee of tuition
 and mandatory fee costs for undergraduate resident students. The purpose of this guarantee is to
 provide financial predictability for students and families. The Guarantee program places each
 student within a cohort that is defined by the date of entry to the university. Each entering freshman
 class will see a one-time increase in tuition and mandatory fees with a lock on that tuition and fees
 for the next four years. The inaugural cohort comprises all resident undergraduate students –
 freshmen and transfers – who enrolled in Fall 2016.

 The CU Boulder Esteemed Scholars Program scholarship program recognizes top Colorado resident
 students for their outstanding academic achievements. These scholarships were first awarded in fall
 2013. Students applying as freshmen for the fall semester are automatically considered for the
 program upon submission of an admissions application to CU Boulder. Named for CU Boulder's first
 presidents, the scholarships include the President Joseph A. Sewall Award ($20,000, paid over 4
 years; $5,000 per year), the President Horace M. Hale Award ($14,000, paid over 4 years; $3,500
 per year), and the President James H. Baker Award ($10,000, paid over 4 years; $2,500 per year).
 The program is merit based; scholarships will be awarded to a select group of entering Colorado
 resident freshman students based on a combination of grade point average and ACT or SAT test
 scores.

 To maintain accessibility, CU Boulder has several financial aid programs for resident
 undergraduates. These programs are for Boulder campus degree-seeking and teacher licensure
 students. They are based on credits taken on the main campus only; continuing education hours are
 not included.

 Out-of-state undergraduates

 Tuition rates for undergraduates not classified as Colorado residents for tuition purposes have been
 covered by the non-resident undergraduate tuition guarantee program since 2005-06. Click here for
 details of the non-resident undergraduate tuition guarantee.

 The Chancellor's Achievement Scholarship (introduced in 2005-06) offers $25,000 over four years to
 the top 25% of out-of-state admitted new freshmen.

 Presidential Scholars are a select group drawn from Chancellor's Achievement Scholars.The
 Presidential Scholarship is awarded to out-of-state students who are in the top 1-3% of the admitted
 nonresident class at CU Boulder. Presidential Scholars receive $55,000 over four years. These

select students are awarded $15,000 per year during their freshman and sophomore years and
$12,500 per year during their junior and senior years. The Presidential Scholars program began in
2006-07.

Transfer Students

Beginning in fall 2017, the CU Boulder Transfer Excellence Scholarship will be awarded to
undergraduate resident and out-of-state students transferring to CU Boulder with a cumulative
college GPA of 3.75 or better and who have completed a minimum of 12 credit hours of college
course work after high school graduation (or equivalent). Amount of the award is $6,000 per year for
out-of-state students and $3,000 per year for in-state students.

Entering Students

The Arts & Humanities (A&H) Merit Scholarship is awarded to incoming resident and out-of-state
freshmen who applied and were admitted with a declared A&H major (from the list of eligible majors
under qualifications). Awardees receive $8,000 total ($2,000 per year).

In response to the White House initiative to expand college opportunities for American students, the
CU Boulder campus has committed to expanding the CU Promise program to include all Pell eligible
students beginning in the fall of 2014. Eligible CU Boulder students who enter as a new freshman or
transfer student are awarded grants plus a work-study award to cover the cost of tuition, required
fees, and estimated books. We anticipate 550 to 600 new students in this program.

Faculty -- Highest Degree

All tenured and tenure-track faculty have a doctorate or other terminal degree. The percentage of full-time
instructional faculty whose highest degree is a doctorate or other terminal degree is X%.

Student to Faculty Ratio

I2. Report the Fall 2017 ratio of full-time equivalent students (full-time plus 1/3 part time) to full-time
equivalent instructional faculty (full time plus 1/3 part time). In the ratio calculations, exclude both faculty
and students in stand-alone graduate or professional programs such as medicine, law, veterinary,
dentistry, social work, business, or public health in which faculty teach virtually only graduate level
students. Do not count undergraduate or graduate student teaching assistants as faculty.

Fall 2017 Student to Faculty ratio: X to 1 (based on X student FTE and X faculty FTE [from X
undergraduate and graduate students excluding law and telecommunications and X instructional faculty
excluding law and telecommunications]).


Undergraduate Class Size

I3. In the table below, please use the following definitions to report information about the size of classes
and class sections offered in the Fall 2017 term.

Class Sections: A class section is an organized course offered for credit, identified by discipline and
number, meeting at a stated time or times in a classroom or similar setting, and not a subsection such as
a laboratory or discussion session. Undergraduate class sections are defined as any sections in which at
least one degree-seeking undergraduate student is enrolled for credit. Exclude distance learning classes
and noncredit classes and individual instruction such as dissertation or thesis research, music instruction,
or one-to-one readings. Exclude students in independent study, co-operative programs, internships,
foreign language taped tutor sessions, practicums, and all students in one-on-one classes. Each class
section should be counted only once and should not be duplicated because of course catalog cross-
listings.

Class Subsections: A class subsection includes any subsection of a course, such as laboratory,
recitation, and discussion subsections that are supplementary in nature and are scheduled to meet
separately from the lecture portion of the course. Undergraduate subsections are defined as any
subsections of courses in which degree-seeking undergraduate students enrolled for credit. As above,
exclude noncredit classes and individual instruction such as dissertation or thesis research, music

instruction, or one-to-one readings. Each class subsection should be counted only once and should not be
duplicated because of cross-listings.

Using the above definitions, please report for each of the following class-size intervals the number of
class sections and class subsections offered in Fall 2017 For example, a lecture class with 800
students who met at another time in 40 separate labs with 20 students should be counted once in the
"100+" column in the class section column and 40 times under the "20-29" column of the class
subsections table.

J. Disciplinary areas of Degrees Conferred: Common Data Set 2017-18
Degrees conferred between July 1, 2016 and June 30, 2017

For each of the following discipline areas, provide the percentage of diplomas/certificates, associate,
and bachelor's degrees awarded. To determine the percentage, use major, not headcount (e.g.,
students with one degree but a double major will be represented twice). Calculate the percentage
from your institution's IPEDS Completions by using the sum of 1st and 2nd majors for each CIP code
as the numerator and the sum of the Grand Total by 1st Majors and the Grand Total by 2nd major as
the denominator. If you prefer, you can compute the percentages using 1st majors only.

Bachelor's Degrees Awarded--includes double and second majors
