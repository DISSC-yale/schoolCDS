Graduation Rates

The items in this section correspond to data elements collected by the IPEDS Web-based Data Collection System's
Graduation Rate Survey (GRS). For complete instructions and definitions of data elements, see the IPEDS GRS Forms
and Instructions for the 2018-19 Survey.

In the following section for bachelorâ€™s or equivalent programs, please disaggregate the Fall 2011 and Fall 2012 cohorts
(formerly CDS B4-B11) into four groups:

       Students who received a Federal Pell Grant*
       Recipients of a subsidized Stafford Loan who did not receive a Pell Grant
       Students who did not receive either a Pell Grant or a subsidized Stafford Loan
       Total (all students, regardless of Pell Grant or subsidized loan status)

*Students who received both a Federal Pell Grant and a subsidized Stafford Loan should be reported in the "Recipients
of a Federal Pell Grant" column.

For each graduation rate grid below, the numbers in the first three columns for Questions A-G should sum to the cohort
total in the fourth column (formerly CDS B4-B11). For each graduation rate grid below, the numbers in the first three
columns for Questions A-G should sum to the cohort total in the fourth column (formerly CDS B4-B11).

For Bachelor's or Equivalent Programs

Please provide data for the Fall 2011 cohort if available. If Fall 2012 cohort data are not available, provide data for the
Fall 2011 cohort.

G1. Undergraduate full-time tuition, required fees, room and board

List the typical tuition, required fees, and room and board for a full-time undergraduate student for the
FULL 2018-2019 academic year (30 semester hours or 45 quarter hours for institutions that derive annual
tuition by multiplying credit hour cost by number of credits). A full academic year refers to the period of
time generally extending from September to June; usually equated to two semesters, two trimesters, three
quarters, or the period covered by a four-one-four plan. Room and board is defined as double occupancy
and 19 meals per week or the maximum meal plan. Required fees include only charges that all full-time
students must pay that are not included in tuition (e.g., registration, health, or activity fees.) Do not include
optional fees (e.g., parking, laboratory use).

*The Office of Financial Aid took a closer look at all the components this year to make sure they were reflective of a realistic cost at CU
Boulder. They found that the previous off-campus housing rate for undergraduate students was lower than what many of our students are
experiencing. They also found the medical component to be higher than our undergraduate students are paying. A small population of
undergraduates enroll in the campus health insurance, which is what this component was there to cover. In addition, changes to medical
coverage nationwide (such as students being able to remain on their parents' health insurance for a longer period of time) have had an
impact. Consequently they removed this expense to reflect a more accurate budget for most CU Boulder students.

Undergraduate Cost of Attendance (Information not requested by CDS)

Cost of attendance (COA) is an estimate of the amount it will cost a student to attend CU Boulder for one
academic year. COA includes: (1) direct education expenses (tuition, fees, books, and supplies) and (2)
indirect education expenses (room, board, personal, and transportation). COA is used in determining the
amount of financial aid for which a student is eligible. Eligibility is a direct function of financial need,
calculated as the difference between total COA and the expected family contribution.

COA for first-year students living on campus:

For in-state residents                                       $31,044
For out of state                                             $56,460

Professors (AAUP) in its annual Faculty Compensation Survey (the part-time definitions are not used by
AAUP). Instructional Faculty is defined as those members of the instructional-research staff whose major
regular assignment is instruction, including those with released time for research. Use the chart below to
determine inclusions and exclusions:

Faculty -- Highest Degree

Nearly all tenured and tenure-track faculty (98%) have a doctorate or other terminal degree. The
percentage of full-time instructional faculty whose highest degree is a doctorate or other terminal degree
is 88%.

Student to Faculty Ratio

I2. Report the Fall 2018 ratio of full-time equivalent students (full-time plus 1/3 part time) to full-time
equivalent instructional faculty (full time plus 1/3 part time). In the ratio calculations, exclude both faculty
and students in stand-alone graduate or professional programs such as medicine, law, veterinary,
dentistry, social work, business, or public health in which faculty teach virtually only graduate level
students. Do not count undergraduate or graduate student teaching assistants as faculty.

Fall 2018 Student to Faculty ratio: 17.7 to 1 (based on 32,108 student FTE and 1,814 faculty FTE [from
36,696 undergraduate and graduate students excluding law and telecommunications and 2,350
instructional faculty excluding law and telecommunications]).


Undergraduate Class Size

I3. In the table below, please use the following definitions to report information about the size of classes
and class sections offered in the Fall 2018 term.

Class Sections: A class section is an organized course offered for credit, identified by discipline and
number, meeting at a stated time or times in a classroom or similar setting, and not a subsection such as
a laboratory or discussion session. Undergraduate class sections are defined as any sections in which at
least one degree-seeking undergraduate student is enrolled for credit. Exclude distance learning classes
and noncredit classes and individual instruction such as dissertation or thesis research, music instruction,
or one-to-one readings. Exclude students in independent study, co-operative programs, internships,
foreign language taped tutor sessions, practicums, and all students in one-on-one classes. Each class
section should be counted only once and should not be duplicated because of course catalog cross-
listings.

Class Subsections: A class subsection includes any subsection of a course, such as laboratory,
recitation, and discussion subsections that are supplementary in nature and are scheduled to meet
separately from the lecture portion of the course. Undergraduate subsections are defined as any
subsections of courses in which degree-seeking undergraduate students enrolled for credit. As above,
exclude noncredit classes and individual instruction such as dissertation or thesis research, music
instruction, or one-to-one readings. Each class subsection should be counted only once and should not be
duplicated because of cross-listings.

Using the above definitions, please report for each of the following class-size intervals the number of
class sections and class subsections offered in Fall 2018 For example, a lecture class with 800
students who met at another time in 40 separate labs with 20 students should be counted once in the
"100+" column in the class section column and 40 times under the "20-29" column of the class
subsections table.

J. Disciplinary areas of Degrees Conferred: Common Data Set 2018-19
Degrees conferred between July 1, 2017 and June 30, 2018

For each of the following discipline areas, provide the percentage of diplomas/certificates, associate,
and bachelor's degrees awarded. To determine the percentage, use major, not headcount (e.g.,
students with one degree but a double major will be represented twice). Calculate the percentage
from your institution's IPEDS Completions by using the sum of 1st and 2nd majors for each CIP code
as the numerator and the sum of the Grand Total by 1st Majors and the Grand Total by 2nd major as
the denominator. If you prefer, you can compute the percentages using 1st majors only.

Bachelor's Degrees Awarded--includes double and second majors
