         B1. Institutional Enrollment--Men and Women: Provide numbers of students for each of the following categories as
         of the institution's official fall reporting date or as of October 15, 2011. Note: Report students formerly designated as

         only.

         G1. Undergraduate full-time tuition, required fees, room and board

         List the typical tuition, required fees, and room and board for a full-time undergraduate student for the
         FULL 2011-2012 academic year (30 semester hours or 45 quarter hours for institutions that derive annual
         tuition by multiplying credit hour cost by number of credits). A full academic year refers to the period of
         time generally extending from September to June; usually equated to two semesters, two trimesters, three
         quarters, or the period covered by a four-one-four plan. Room and board is defined as double occupancy
         and 19 meals per week or the maximum meal plan. Required fees include only charges that all full-time
         students must pay that are not included in tuition (e.g., registration, health, or activity fees.) Do not include
         optional fees (e.g., parking, laboratory use).

         Undergraduate Cost of Attendance (Information not requested by CDS)

         Cost of attendance (COA) is an estimate of the amount it will cost a student to attend CU-Boulder for one
         academic year. COA includes: (1) direct education expenses (tuition, fees, books, and supplies) and (2)
         indirect education expenses (room, board, personal, medical, and transportation). COA is used in
         determining the amount of financial aid for which a student is eligible. Eligibility is a direct function of
         financial need, calculated as the difference between total COA and the expected family contribution.

         COA for first-year students living on campus:

         Aid Awarded to Enrolled Undergraduates

         NOTE: 2011-12 estimates will be posted when they become available. The notes in H15 have
         been updated for 2010-11.

         H1. Enter total dollar amounts awarded to full-time and less than full-time degree-seeking
         undergraduates (using the same cohort reported in CDS Question B1, "total degree-seeking"
         undergraduates) in the following categories. (Note: If the data being reported are final figures for the
         2010-2011 academic year (see the next item below), use the 2010-2011 academic year's CDS Question
         B1 cohort.) Include aid awarded to international students (i.e., those not qualifying for federal aid). Aid
         that is non-need-based but that was used to meet need should be reported in the need-based aid
         columns. (For a suggested order of precedence in assigning categories of aid to cover need, see the
         entry for "non-need-based scholarship or grant aid" on the last page of the definitions section.)

         Indicate the academic year for which data are reported for items H1, H2, H2A and H6 below:

         H15. If your institution has recently implemented any major financial aid policy, program, or initiative to
         make your institution more affordable to incoming students such as replacing loans with grants, or
         waiving costs for families below a certain income level, please provide details below.


          Colorado resident undergraduates

          To maintain accessibility, CU-Boulder has several financial aid programs for resident
          undergraduates. These programs are for Boulder campus degree-seeking and teacher licensure
          students. They are based on credits taken on the main campus only; continuing education hours are
          not included.

          Programs include the UCB Tuition Grant and the CU Promise, part of CU's performance contract
          with the Colorado Commission on Higher Education. The CU Promise covers Colorado
          undergraduates from families at or below the federal poverty line who enter CU-Boulder as new
          freshmen or transfer students. For these students, grants plus a work-study award will cover the cost
          of tuition, required fees, and estimated books. More than 100 new students are covered by the CU
          Promise each year.

           Out-of-state undergraduates

           Tuition rates for undergraduates not classified as Colorado residents for tuition purposes have been
           covered by the non-resident undergraduate tuition guarantee program since 2005-06. Rates for
           students entering summer 2011 through spring 2012 are 5% higher than those for students entering
           the prior year.

           Click here for details of the non-resident undergraduate tuition guarantee.

           Beginning 2011-12, the Chancellor's Achievement Scholarship (introduced in 2005-06) now offers
           $20,000 over four years to the top 25% of out-of-state admitted new freshmen.

           Presidential Scholars are a select group drawn from Chancellor's Achievement Scholars.
           Presidential Scholars receive $55,000 over four years. These select students are awarded $15,000
           per year during their freshman and sophomore years and $12,500 per year during their junior and
           senior years. The Presidential Scholars program began in 2006-07.

         dentistry, social work, business, or public health in which faculty teach virtually only graduate level
         students. Do not count undergraduate or graduate student teaching assistants as faculty.

         Fall 2011 Student to Faculty ratio: 19.6 to 1 (based on 28,116 student FTE and 1,435 faculty FTE
         [31,850 undergraduate students and 1,920 faculty]).

         I3. In the table below, please use the following definitions to report information about the size of classes
         and class sections offered in the Fall 2011 term.

         Class Sections: A class section is an organized course offered for credit, identified by discipline and
         number, meeting at a stated time or times in a classroom or similar setting, and not a subsection such as
         a laboratory or discussion session. Undergraduate class sections are defined as any sections in which at
         least one degree-seeking undergraduate student is enrolled for credit. Exclude distance learning classes
         and noncredit classes and individual instruction such as dissertation or thesis research, music instruction,
         or one-to-one readings. Exclude students in independent study, co-operative programs, internships,
         foreign language taped tutor sessions, practicums, and all students in one-on-one classes. Each class
         section should be counted only once and should not be duplicated because of course catalog cross-
         listings.

         Class Subsections: A class subsection includes any subsection of a course, such as laboratory,
         recitation, and discussion subsections that are supplementary in nature and are scheduled to meet
         separately from the lecture portion of the course. Undergraduate subsections are defined as any
         subsections of courses in which degree-seeking undergraduate students enrolled for credit. As above,
         exclude noncredit classes and individual instruction such as dissertation or thesis research, music
         instruction, or one-to-one readings. Each class subsection should be counted only once and should not
         be duplicated because of cross-listings.

         Using the above definitions, please report for each of the following class-size intervals the number of
         class sections and class subsections offered in Fall 2010 For example, a lecture class with 800
         students who met at another time in 40 separate labs with 20 students should be counted once in the
         "100+" column in the class section column and 40 times under the "20-29" column of the class
         subsections table.

         J. Degrees Conferred: Common Data Set 2011-12
         Degrees conferred between July 1, 2010 and June 30, 2011

         For each of the following discipline areas, provide the percentage of diplomas/certificates, associate,
         and bachelor's degrees awarded. To determine the percentage, use major, not headcount (e.g.,
         students with one degree but a double major will be represented twice). Calculate the percentage
         from your institution's IPEDS Completions by using the sum of 1st and 2nd majors for each CIP code
         as the numerator and the sum of the Grand Total by 1st Majors and the Grand Total by 2nd major as
         the denominator. If you prefer, you can compute the percentages using 1st majors only.

         Undergraduate Degrees Only--includes double and second majors
