         only.

         C1. First-time, first-year (freshman) students:

         Provide the number of degree-seeking, first-time, first-year students who applied, were admitted, and
         enrolled (full- or part-time) in fall 2013. Include early decision, early action, and students who began
         studies during summer in this cohort. Applicants should include only those students who fulfilled the
         requirements for consideration for admission (i.e., who completed actionable applications) and who
         have been notified of one of the following actions: admission, nonadmission, placement on waiting list,
         or application withdrawn (by applicant or institution). Admitted applicants should include wait-listed
         students who were subsequently offered admission.

         G1. Undergraduate full-time tuition, required fees, room and board

         List the typical tuition, required fees, and room and board for a full-time undergraduate student for the
         FULL 2014-2015 academic year (30 semester hours or 45 quarter hours for institutions that derive annual
         tuition by multiplying credit hour cost by number of credits). A full academic year refers to the period of
         time generally extending from September to June; usually equated to two semesters, two trimesters, three
         quarters, or the period covered by a four-one-four plan. Room and board is defined as double occupancy
         and 19 meals per week or the maximum meal plan. Required fees include only charges that all full-time
         students must pay that are not included in tuition (e.g., registration, health, or activity fees.) Do not include
         optional fees (e.g., parking, laboratory use).

         indirect education expenses (room, board, personal, medical, and transportation). COA is used in
         determining the amount of financial aid for which a student is eligible. Eligibility is a direct function of
         financial need, calculated as the difference between total COA and the expected family contribution.

         COA for first-year students living on campus:

         B1 cohort.) Include aid awarded to international students (i.e., those not qualifying for federal aid). Aid

          Colorado resident undergraduates

          The CU-Boulder Esteemed Scholars Program is a new scholarship program recognizing top
          Colorado resident students for their outstanding academic achievements. These scholarships were
          first awarded in fall 2013. Students applying as freshmen for the fall semester are automatically
          considered for the program upon submission of an admissions application to CU-Boulder. Named for
          CU-Boulder's first presidents, the scholarships include the President Joseph A. Sewall Award
          ($20,000, paid over 4 years; $5,000 per year), the President Horace M. Hale Award ($14,000, paid
          over 4 years; $3,500 per year), and the President James H. Baker Award ($10,000, paid over 4
          years; $2,500 per year). The program is merit based; scholarships will be awarded to a select group
          of entering Colorado resident freshman students based on a combination of grade point average and

           ACT or SAT test scores.

           To maintain accessibility, CU-Boulder has several financial aid programs for resident
           undergraduates. These programs are for Boulder campus degree-seeking and teacher licensure
           students. They are based on credits taken on the main campus only; continuing education hours are
           not included.

           Programs include the UCB Tuition Grant and the CU Promise, part of CU's performance contract
           with the Colorado Commission on Higher Education. The CU Promise covers Colorado
           undergraduates from families at or below the federal poverty line who enter CU-Boulder as new
           freshmen or transfer students. For these students, grants plus a work-study award will cover the cost
           of tuition, required fees, and estimated books. More than 100 new students are covered by the CU
           Promise each year.

           Out-of-state undergraduates

           Tuition rates for undergraduates not classified as Colorado residents for tuition purposes have been
           covered by the non-resident undergraduate tuition guarantee program since 2005-06. Rates for
           students entering summer 2013 through spring 2014 are 1.9% higher than those for students
           entering the prior year.

           Click here for details of the non-resident undergraduate tuition guarantee.

           The Chancellor's Achievement Scholarship (introduced in 2005-06) offers $20,000 over four years to
           the top 25% of out-of-state admitted new freshmen.

           Presidential Scholars are a select group drawn from Chancellor's Achievement Scholars.
           Presidential Scholars receive $55,000 over four years. These select students are awarded $15,000
           per year during their freshman and sophomore years and $12,500 per year during their junior and
           senior years. The Presidential Scholars program began in 2006-07.

         students. Do not count undergraduate or graduate student teaching assistants as faculty.

         Fall 2011 Student to Faculty ratio: 18.0 to 1 (based on 27,560 student FTE and 1,528 faculty FTE [from
         32,007 undergraduate and graduate students excluding law and telecommunications and 2,110

         Undergraduate Class Size

         I3. In the table below, please use the following definitions to report information about the size of classes
         and class sections offered in the Fall 2013 term.

         Class Sections: A class section is an organized course offered for credit, identified by discipline and
         number, meeting at a stated time or times in a classroom or similar setting, and not a subsection such as
         a laboratory or discussion session. Undergraduate class sections are defined as any sections in which at
         least one degree-seeking undergraduate student is enrolled for credit. Exclude distance learning classes
         and noncredit classes and individual instruction such as dissertation or thesis research, music instruction,
         or one-to-one readings. Exclude students in independent study, co-operative programs, internships,
         foreign language taped tutor sessions, practicums, and all students in one-on-one classes. Each class
         section should be counted only once and should not be duplicated because of course catalog cross-
         listings.

         Class Subsections: A class subsection includes any subsection of a course, such as laboratory,
         recitation, and discussion subsections that are supplementary in nature and are scheduled to meet
         separately from the lecture portion of the course. Undergraduate subsections are defined as any
         subsections of courses in which degree-seeking undergraduate students enrolled for credit. As above,
         exclude noncredit classes and individual instruction such as dissertation or thesis research, music
         instruction, or one-to-one readings. Each class subsection should be counted only once and should not
         be duplicated because of cross-listings.

         Using the above definitions, please report for each of the following class-size intervals the number of
         class sections and class subsections offered in Fall 2013 For example, a lecture class with 800
         students who met at another time in 40 separate labs with 20 students should be counted once in the
         "100+" column in the class section column and 40 times under the "20-29" column of the class
         subsections table.

         J. Degrees Conferred: Common Data Set 2013-14
         Degrees conferred between July 1, 2012 and June 30, 2013

         For each of the following discipline areas, provide the percentage of diplomas/certificates, associate,
         and bachelor's degrees awarded. To determine the percentage, use major, not headcount (e.g.,
         students with one degree but a double major will be represented twice). Calculate the percentage
         from your institution's IPEDS Completions by using the sum of 1st and 2nd majors for each CIP code
         as the numerator and the sum of the Grand Total by 1st Majors and the Grand Total by 2nd major as
         the denominator. If you prefer, you can compute the percentages using 1st majors only.

         Undergraduate Degrees Only--includes double and second majors
