G1. Undergraduate full-time tuition, required fees, room and board

List the typical tuition, required fees, and room and board for a full-time undergraduate student for the
FULL 2016-2017 academic year (30 semester hours or 45 quarter hours for institutions that derive annual
tuition by multiplying credit hour cost by number of credits). A full academic year refers to the period of
time generally extending from September to June; usually equated to two semesters, two trimesters,
three quarters, or the period covered by a four-one-four plan. Room and board is defined as double
occupancy and 19 meals per week or the maximum meal plan. Required fees include only charges that
all full-time students must pay that are not included in tuition (e.g., registration, health, or activity fees.)
Do not include optional fees (e.g., parking, laboratory use).

*The Office of Financial Aid took a closer look at all the components this year to make sure they were
reflective of a realistic cost at CU-Boulder. They found that the previous off-campus housing rate for
undergraduate students was lower than what many of our students are experiencing. They also found the
medical component to be higher than our undergraduate students are paying. A small population of
undergraduates enroll in the campus health insurance, which is what this component was there to cover.

In addition, changes to medical coverage nationwide (such as students being able to remain on their
parents health insurance for a longer period of time) have had an impact. Consequently, they removed
this expense to reflect a more accurate budget for most CU-Boulder students.

Undergraduate Cost of Attendance (Information not requested by CDS)

Cost of attendance (COA) is an estimate of the amount it will cost a student to attend CU-Boulder for one
academic year. COA includes: (1) direct education expenses (tuition, fees, books, and supplies) and (2)
indirect education expenses (room, board, personal, medical, and transportation). COA is used in
determining the amount of financial aid for which a student is eligible. Eligibility is a direct function of
financial need, calculated as the difference between total COA and the expected family contribution.

COA for first-year students living on campus:


For in-state residents                         $28,380

For out of state                               $52,090

 Colorado resident undergraduates

 The CU-Boulder Esteemed Scholars Program scholarship program recognizes top Colorado
 resident students for their outstanding academic achievements. These scholarships were first
 awarded in fall 2013. Students applying as freshmen for the fall semester are automatically
 considered for the program upon submission of an admissions application to CU-Boulder. Named
 for CU-Boulder's first presidents, the scholarships include the President Joseph A. Sewall Award
 ($20,000, paid over 4 years; $5,000 per year), the President Horace M. Hale Award ($14,000,
 paid over 4 years; $3,500 per year), and the President James H. Baker Award ($10,000, paid over
 4 years; $2,500 per year). The program is merit based; scholarships will be awarded to a select
 group of entering Colorado resident freshman students based on a combination of grade point
 average and ACT or SAT test scores.

 In response to the White House initiative to expand college opportunities for American students,
 the CU-Boulder campus has committed to expanding the CU Promise program to include all Pell

eligible students beginning in the fall of 2014. Eligible CU Boulder students who enter as a new
freshman or transfer student are awarded grants plus a work-study award to cover the cost of
tuition, required fees and estimated books. We anticipate 550 to 600 new students in this
program.

To maintain accessibility, CU-Boulder has several financial aid programs for resident
undergraduates. These programs are for Boulder campus degree-seeking and teacher licensure
students. They are based on credits taken on the main campus only; continuing education hours
are not included.

Out-of-state undergraduates

Tuition rates for undergraduates not classified as Colorado residents for tuition purposes have
been covered by the non-resident undergraduate tuition guarantee program since 2005-06. Click
here for details of the non-resident undergraduate tuition guarantee.

The Chancellor's Achievement Scholarship (introduced in 2005-06) offers $25,000 over four years
to the top 25% of out-of-state admitted new freshmen.

Presidential Scholars are a select group drawn from Chancellor's Achievement Scholars.
Presidential Scholars receive $55,000 over four years. These select students are awarded
$15,000 per year during their freshman and sophomore years and $12,500 per year during their
junior and senior years. The Presidential Scholars program began in 2006-07.

Student to Faculty Ratio

I2. Report the Fall 2015 ratio of full-time equivalent students (full-time plus 1/3 part time) to full-time
equivalent instructional faculty (full time plus 1/3 part time). In the ratio calculations, exclude both faculty
and students in stand-alone graduate or professional programs such as medicine, law, veterinary,
dentistry, social work, business, or public health in which faculty teach virtually only graduate level
students. Do not count undergraduate or graduate student teaching assistants as faculty.

Fall 2015 Student to Faculty ratio: 17.7 to 1 (based on 28,661 student FTE and 1,618 faculty FTE [from
32,320 undergraduate and graduate students excluding law and telecommunications and 1,961
instructional faculty excluding law and telecommunications]). [updated 3/22/2016]


Undergraduate Class Size

I3. In the table below, please use the following definitions to report information about the size of classes
and class sections offered in the Fall 2015 term.

Class Sections: A class section is an organized course offered for credit, identified by discipline and
number, meeting at a stated time or times in a classroom or similar setting, and not a subsection such as
a laboratory or discussion session. Undergraduate class sections are defined as any sections in which at
least one degree-seeking undergraduate student is enrolled for credit. Exclude distance learning classes
and noncredit classes and individual instruction such as dissertation or thesis research, music instruction,
or one-to-one readings. Exclude students in independent study, co-operative programs, internships,
foreign language taped tutor sessions, practicums, and all students in one-on-one classes. Each class
section should be counted only once and should not be duplicated because of course catalog cross-
listings.

Class Subsections: A class subsection includes any subsection of a course, such as laboratory,
recitation, and discussion subsections that are supplementary in nature and are scheduled to meet
separately from the lecture portion of the course. Undergraduate subsections are defined as any
subsections of courses in which degree-seeking undergraduate students enrolled for credit. As above,
exclude noncredit classes and individual instruction such as dissertation or thesis research, music
instruction, or one-to-one readings. Each class subsection should be counted only once and should not
be duplicated because of cross-listings.

Using the above definitions, please report for each of the following class-size intervals the number
ofclass sections and class subsections offered in Fall 2014 For example, a lecture class with 800
students who met at another time in 40 separate labs with 20 students should be counted once in the
"100+" column in the class section column and 40 times under the "20-29" column of the class
subsections table.

J. Degrees Conferred: Common Data Set 2015-16
Degrees conferred between July 1, 2014 and June 30, 2015

For each of the following discipline areas, provide the percentage of diplomas/certificates, associate, and
bachelor's degrees awarded. To determine the percentage, use major, not headcount (e.g., students with
one degree but a double major will be represented twice). Calculate the percentage from your institution's
IPEDS Completions by using the sum of 1st and 2nd majors for each CIP code as the numerator and the
sum of the Grand Total by 1st Majors and the Grand Total by 2nd major as the denominator. If you
prefer, you can compute the percentages using 1st majors only.

Undergraduate Degrees Only--includes double and second majors

applications/forms, such as the FAFSA.

Indebtedness: Aggregate dollar amount borrowed through any loan programs (federal, state, subsidized,

Student loans co-signed by a parent are assumed to be the responsibility of the student and should be
included.

which the institution determines the recipient.

Financial need: As determined by your institution using the federal methodology and/or your institution's
