             Provide numbers of undergraduate students for each of the following categories as of the institution’s official fall reporting date or as
             of October 19, 2022.
             • Include international students only in the category "Nonresidents."
             •   Complete the “Total Undergraduates” column only if you cannot provide data for the first two columns.
             •   Report as your institution reports to IPEDS: persons who are Hispanic should be reported only on the
                 Hispanic line, not under any race, and persons who are non-Hispanic multi-racial should be reported only
                 under "Two or more races."
             •   New guidance from IPEDS for reporting aggregate data:
             Racial/ethnic designations are requested only for United States citizens, residents, and other eligible non-citizens.
             Eligible non-citizens include all students who completed high school or a GED equivalency within the United States
             (including DACA and undocumented students) and who were not on an F-1 non-immigrant student visa at the time of
             high school graduation.
             More information about other eligible (for financial aid purposes) non-citizens is available at
             https://studentaid.gov/understandaid/eligibility/requirements/non-us-citizens.

             Nonresident - A person who is not a citizen or national of the United States and who is in this country on a student visa
             or temporary basis and does not have the right to remain indefinitely. Do not include DACA, undocumented, or other
             eligible noncitizens in this category.

             NOTE - Nonresidents are to be reported separately, in the boxes provided, rather than included in any of the seven
             racial/ethnic categories or in race/ethnicity unknown.

             The items in this section correspond to data elements collected by the IPEDS Web-based Data Collection System’s Graduation
             Rate Survey (GRS).

             •    For complete instructions and definitions of data elements, see the IPEDS GRS Forms and Instructions
                  for the 2022-2023 Survey. https://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/use-the-data/survey-components/9/graduation-rates

             In the following section for bachelor’s or equivalent programs, please disaggregate the Fall 2015 and Fall 2016 cohorts
             (formerly CDS B4-B11) into four groups:
             • Students who received a Federal Pell Grant*
             • Recipients of a subsidized Stafford Loan who did not receive a Pell Grant
             • Students who did not receive either a Pell Grant or a subsidized Stafford Loan
             • Total (all students, regardless of Pell Grant or subsidized loan status)

             *Students who received both a Federal Pell Grant and a subsidized Stafford Loan should be reported in the "Recipients of a Federal
             Pell Grant" column.

             For each graduation rate grid below, the numbers in the first three columns for Questions A-G should sum to the cohort total in the
             fourth column (formerly CDS B4-B11).

             cohort.

                I-3. Undergraduate Class Size
                    In the table below, please use the following definitions to report information about the size of classes and
                    class sections offered in the Fall 2022 term.
                    • Please include classes that have been moved online in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

                    Class Sections: A class section is an organized course offered for credit, identified by discipline and
                    number, meeting at a stated time or times in a classroom or similar setting, and not a subsection such as a
                    laboratory or discussion session. Undergraduate class sections are defined as any sections in which at least
                    one degree-seeking undergraduate student is enrolled for credit. Exclude distance learning classes and
                    noncredit classes and individual instruction such as dissertation or thesis research, music instruction, or one-
                    to-one readings. Exclude students in independent study, co-operative programs, internships, foreign language
                    taped tutor sessions, practicums, and all students in one-on-one classes. Each class section should be
                    counted only once and should not be duplicated because of course catalog cross-listings.

                    Class Subsections: A class subsection includes any subsection of a course, such as laboratory, recitation,
                    and discussion subsections that are supplementary in nature and are scheduled to meet separately from the
                    lecture portion of the course. Undergraduate subsections are defined as any subsections of courses in which
                    degree-seeking undergraduate students enrolled for credit. As above, exclude noncredit classes and
                    individual instruction such as dissertation or thesis research, music instruction, or one-to-one readings. Each
                    class subsection should be counted only once and should not be duplicated because of cross-listings.


                    Using the above definitions, please report for each of the following class-size intervals the number of class
                    sections and class subsections offered in Fall 2022. For example, a lecture class with 800 students who
                    met at another time in 40 separate labs with 20 students should be counted once in the “100+” column in the
                    class section column and 40 times under the “20-29” column of the class subsections table.

                                     J. Disciplinary areas of DEGREES CONFERRED
             J1 Degrees conferred between July 1, 2021 and June 30, 2022
                For each of the following discipline areas, provide the percentage of diplomas/certificates, associate, and bachelor’s
                degrees awarded. To determine the percentage, use majors, not headcount (e.g., students with one degree but a
                double major will be represented twice). Calculate the percentage from your institution’s IPEDS Completions by using
                the sum of 1st and 2nd majors for each CIP code as the numerator and the sum of the Grand Total by 1st Majors and
                the Grand Total by 2nd major as the denominator. If you prefer, you can compute the percentages using 1st majors
                only
