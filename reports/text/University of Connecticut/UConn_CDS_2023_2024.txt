B2   Enrollment by Racial/Ethnic Category.
     Provide numbers of undergraduate students for each of the following categories as of the institution’s official fall reporting date or
     as of October 15, 2023.
     • Include international students only in the category "Nonresidents."
     •   Complete the “Total Undergraduates” column only if you cannot provide data for the first two columns.
     •   Report as your institution reports to IPEDS: persons who are Hispanic should be reported only on the
         Hispanic line, not under any race, and persons who are non-Hispanic multi-racial should be reported only
         under "Two or more races."
     •   New guidance from IPEDS for reporting aggregate data:
     Racial/ethnic designations are requested only for United States citizens, residents, and other eligible non-citizens.
     Eligible non-citizens include all students who completed high school or a GED equivalency within the United States
     (including DACA and undocumented students) and who were not on an F-1 non-immigrant student visa at the time of
     high school graduation.

     More information about other eligible (for financial aid purposes) non-citizens is available at
     https://studentaid.gov/understandaid/eligibility/requirements/non-us-citizens.

     Nonresident - A person who is not a citizen or national of the United States and who is in this country on a student visa
     or temporary basis and does not have the right to remain indefinitely. Do not include DACA, undocumented, or other
     eligible noncitizens in this category.

     NOTE - Nonresidents are to be reported separately, in the boxes provided, rather than included in any of the seven
     racial/ethnic categories or in race/ethnicity unknown.

     B4-B21: Graduation Rates
     The items in this section correspond to data elements collected by the IPEDS Web-based Data Collection System’s Graduation
     Rate Survey (GRS).

     •   For complete instructions and definitions of data elements, see the IPEDS GRS Forms and Instructions
         for the 2023-2024 Survey. https://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/use-the-data/survey-components/9/graduation-rates

     In the following section for bachelor’s or equivalent programs, please disaggregate the Fall 2016 and Fall 2017 cohorts (formerly CDS B4-
     B11) into four groups:
     • Students who received a Federal Pell Grant*
     • Recipients of a subsidized Stafford Loan who did not receive a Pell Grant
     • Students who did not receive either a Pell Grant or a subsidized Stafford Loan
     • Total (all students, regardless of Pell Grant or subsidized loan status)

     *Students who received both a Federal Pell Grant and a subsidized Stafford Loan should be reported in the "Recipients of a Federal Pell Grant"
     column.

     For each graduation rate grid below, the numbers in the first three columns for Questions A-G should sum to the cohort total in the fourth column
     (formerly CDS B4-B11).
                                                  For Bachelor’s or Equivalent Programs

     Please provide data for the Fall 2017 cohort if available. If Fall 2016 cohort data are not available, provide data for the Fall 2016 cohort.

     Report for the cohort of all full-time, first-time bachelor’s (or equivalent) degree-seeking undergraduate students who entered in
     Fall 2022 (or the preceding summer term).
     • The initial cohort may be adjusted for students who departed for the following reasons:
     * Death
     * Permanent Disability
     * Service in the armed forces
     * Foreign aid service of the federal government
     * Official church missions
     * No other adjustments to the initial cohort should be made.

    Total students retained = students from the Fall 2022 cohort who are still enrolled as of Fall 2023 +
    students from Fall 2022 cohort who completed their bachelor’s program as of Fall 2023

    completed their bachelor’s program as of Fall 2023)/(Adjusted Fall 2022 cohort) *100

    Note: The number of first-time students seeking a bachelor’s degree (or equivalent) who attain a
    bachelor’s degree (or equivalent) by their second fall term is expected to be zero or very small. In
    exceptional cases when a first-time student does satisfy all degree requirements including full credit
    completion (e.g., typically 120 credit hours) and is awarded a bachelor’s degree (or equivalent) by their
    second fall term, they are to be considered “retained” for EF reporting purposes.

             you use the data. For example:
         •   If you consider the highest scores from either submission, use the highest combination of scores
             (e.g., verbal from one submission, math from the other).
         •   If you average the scores, use the average to report the scores.

                                           H. FINANCIAL AID
     Please refer to the following financial aid definitions when completing Section H.
     Awarded aid: The dollar amounts offered to financial aid applicants.
     Financial aid applicant: Any applicant who submits any one of the institutionally required financial aid
     applications/forms, such as the FAFSA.
     Indebtedness: Aggregate dollar amount borrowed through any loan program (federal, state, subsidized,
     unsubsidized, private, etc.; excluding parent loans) while the student was enrolled at an institution. Student
     loans co-signed by a parent are assumed to be the responsibility of the student and should be included.
     Institutional scholarships and grants: Endowed scholarships, annual gifts and tuition funded grants for
     which the institution determines the recipient.
     Financial need: As determined by your institution using the federal methodology and/or your institution's
     own standards.
     Need-based aid: College-funded or college-administered award from institutional, state, federal, or other
     sources for which a student must have financial need to qualify. This includes both institutional and non-
     institutional student aid (grants, jobs, and loans).
     Need-based scholarship or grant aid: Scholarships and grants from institutional, state, federal, or other
     sources for which a student must have financial need to qualify.
     Need-based self-help aid: Loans and jobs from institutional, state, federal, or other sources for which a
     student must demonstrate financial need to qualify.
     Non-need-based scholarship or grant aid: Scholarships and grants, gifts, or merit-based aid from
     institutional, state, federal, or other sources (including unrestricted funds or gifts and endowment income)
     awarded solely on the basis of academic achievement, merit, or any other non-need-based reason. When
     reporting questions H1 and H2, non-need-based aid that is used to meet need should be counted as need-
     based aid.
     Note: Suggested order of precedence for counting non-need money as need-based:
        1. Non-need institutional grants                         6. Non-need outside grants
        2. Non-need tuition waivers                              7. Non-need student loans
        3. Non-need athletic awards                              8. Non-need parent loans
        4. Non-need federal grants                               9. Non-need work
        5. Non-need state grants
     Non-need-based self-help aid: Loans and jobs from institutional, state, or other sources for which a student
     need not demonstrate financial need to qualify.
     Private student loans: A nonfederal loan made by a lender such as a bank, credit union or private lender
     used to pay for up to the annual cost of education, less any financial aid received.
     External scholarships and grants: Scholarships and grants received from outside (private) sources that
     students bring with them (e.g., Kiwanis, National Merit scholarships). The institution may process paperwork
     to receive the dollars, but it has no role in determining the recipient or the dollar amount awarded.
     Work study and employment: Federal and state work study aid, and any employment packaged by your
     institution in financial aid awards.

     DO NOT INCLUDE ANY AID RELATED TO THE CARES ACT OR UNIQUE THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC

     Aid Awarded to Enrolled Undergraduates
H1   Enter total dollar amounts awarded to enrolled full-time and less than full-time degree-seeking
     undergraduates (using the same cohort reported in CDS Question B1, “total degree-seeking”
     undergraduates) in the following categories.
     •   If the data being reported are final figures for the 2022-2023 academic year (see the next item below),
         use the 2022-2023 academic year's CDS Question B1 cohort.
     •   Include aid awarded to international students (i.e., those not qualifying for federal aid).
     •   Aid that is non-need-based but that was used to meet need should be reported in the need-based aid
         column.
     •   For a suggested order of precedence in assigning categories of aid to cover need, see the entry for “non-
         need-based scholarship or grant aid” on the last page of the definitions section.
     •   Do NOT include any aid related to the CARES Act or unique to the COVID-19 pandemic.

I-1. Please report the number of instructional faculty members in each category for Fall 2023. Include
     faculty who are on your institution’s payroll on the census date your institution uses for IPEDS/AAUP.

       The following definition of full-time instructional faculty is used by the American Association of University Professors
       (AAUP) in its annual Faculty Compensation Survey (the part time definitions are not used by AAUP). Instructional
       Faculty is defined as those members of the instructional-research staff whose major regular assignment is instruction,
       including those with released time for research. Use the chart below to determine inclusions and exclusions:

I-3. Undergraduate Class Size
    In the table below, please use the following definitions to report information about the size of classes and class
    sections offered in the Fall 2023 term.
    Class Sections: A class section is an organized course offered for credit, identified by discipline and number,
    meeting at a stated time or times in a classroom or similar setting, and not a subsection such as a laboratory
    or discussion session. Undergraduate class sections are defined as any sections in which at least one degree-
    seeking undergraduate student is enrolled for credit. Exclude distance learning classes and noncredit classes
    and individual instruction such as dissertation or thesis research, music instruction, or one-to-one readings.
    Exclude students in independent study, co-operative programs, internships, foreign language taped tutor
    sessions, practicums, and all students in one-on-one classes. Each class section should be counted only once
    and should not be duplicated because of course catalog cross-listings.

    Class Subsections: A class subsection includes any subsection of a course, such as laboratory, recitation,
    and discussion subsections that are supplementary in nature and are scheduled to meet separately from the
    lecture portion of the course. Undergraduate subsections are defined as any subsections of courses in which
    degree-seeking undergraduate students enrolled for credit. As above, exclude noncredit classes and individual
    instruction such as dissertation or thesis research, music instruction, or one-to-one readings. Each class
    subsection should be counted only once and should not be duplicated because of cross-listings.


    Using the above definitions, please report for each of the following class-size intervals the number of class
    sections and class subsections offered in Fall 2023. For example, a lecture class with 800 students who met
    at another time in 40 separate labs with 20 students should be counted once in the “100+” column in the class
    section column and 40 times under the “20-29” column of the class subsections table.

J1   Degrees conferred between July 1, 2022 and June 30, 2023
     For each of the following discipline areas, provide the percentage of diplomas/certificates, associate, and bachelor’s degrees awarded. To
     determine the percentage, use majors, not headcount (e.g., students with one degree but a double major will be represented twice).
     Calculate the percentage from your institution’s IPEDS Completions by using the sum of 1st and 2nd majors for each CIP code as the
     numerator and the sum of the Grand Total by 1st Majors and the Grand Total by 2nd major as the denominator. If you prefer, you can
     compute the percentages using 1st majors only.
