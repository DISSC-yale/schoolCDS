                                                    H. FINANCIAL AID

Please refer to the following financial aid definitions when completing Section H.

Awarded aid: The dollar amounts offered to financial aid applicants.

Financial aid applicant: Any applicant who submits any one of the institutionally required financial aid applications/forms,
such as the FAFSA.

Indebtedness: Aggregate dollar amount borrowed through any loan programs (federal, state, subsidized, unsubsidized, private,
etc.; excluding parent loans) while the student was enrolled at an institution. Student loans co-signed by a parent are assumed to
be the responsibility of the student and should be included.

Institutional scholarships and grants: Endowed scholarships, alumni gifts and tuition funded grants for which the institution
determines the recipient.

Financial need: As determined by your institution using the federal methodology and/or your institution's own standards.

Need-based aid: College-funded or college-administered award from institutional, state, federal, or other sources for which a
student must have financial need to qualify. This includes both institutional and noninstitutional student aid (grants, jobs, and
loans).

Need-based scholarship or grant aid: Scholarships and grants from institutional, state, federal, or other sources for which a
student must have financial need to qualify.

Need-based self-help aid: Loans and jobs from institutional, state, federal, or other sources for which a student must
demonstrate financial need to qualify.

Non-need-based scholarship or grant aid: Scholarships and grants, gifts, or merit-based aid from institutional, state, federal,
or other sources (including unrestricted funds or gifts and endowment income) awarded solely on the basis of academic
achievement, merit, or any other non-need-based reason. When reporting questions H1 and H2, non-need-based aid that is used
to meet need should be counted as need-based aid.

    Note: Suggested order of precedence for counting non-need money as need-based:
    Non-need institutional grants
    Non-need tuition waivers
    Non-need athletic awards
    Non-need federal grants
    Non-need state grants
    Non-need outside grants
    Non-need student loans
    Non-need parent loans
    Non-need work

Non-need-based self-help aid: Loans and jobs from institutional, state, or other sources for which a student need not
demonstrate financial need to qualify.

External scholarships and grants: Scholarships and grants received from outside (private) sources that students bring with
them (e.g., Kiwanis, National Merit scholarships). The institution may process paperwork to receive the dollars, but it has no
role in determining the recipient or the dollar amount awarded.

Work study and employment: Federal and state work study aid, and any employment packaged by your institution in financial
aid awards.

H15. If your institution has recently implemented any major financial aid policy, program, or initiative to make
your institution more affordable to incoming students such as replacing loans with grants, or waiving costs for
families below a certain income level please provide details below:

A new initiative, Commitment to Delawareans, started in 2009-10. The goal is to meet the full need of Delawareans, with need
calculated based on tuition and fees, on-campus housing, meals, and $800 for books a year. This was implemented for the
incoming Fall 2009 freshman. Once started, it continues for 4 years, with a new freshman class added each year.

I-2. Student to Faculty Ratio

Report the fall 2014 ratio of full-time equivalent students (full-time plus 1/3 part time) to full-time equivalent instructional
faculty (full time plus 1/3 part time). In the ratio calculations, exclude both faculty and students in stand-alone graduate or
professional programs such as medicine, law, veterinary, dentistry, social work, business, or public health in which faculty teach
virtually only graduate level students. Do not count undergraduate or graduate student teaching assistants as faculty.

Fall 2014 Student to Faculty ratio:     13     to 1 (based on Newark Campus undergraduate and faculty).

(16,694 full-time + 718 part-time/3 Newark Campus undergraduate students) / (1,157 full-time + 444 part-time/3 Newark
campus faculty)

Fall 2014 Student to Faculty ratio:     15     to 1 (based on Newark Campus undergraduate, graduate students and faculty).

I-3. Undergraduate Class Size

In the table below, please use the following definitions to report information about the size of classes and class sections offered
in the fall 2014 term.

Class Sections: A class section is an organized course offered for credit, identified by discipline and number, meeting at a
stated time or times in a classroom or similar setting, and not a subsection such as a laboratory or discussion session.
Undergraduate class sections are defined as any sections in which at least one degree-seeking undergraduate student is enrolled
for credit. Exclude distance learning classes and noncredit classes and individual instruction such as dissertation or thesis
research, music instruction, or one-to-one readings. Exclude students in independent study, co-operative programs, internships,
foreign language taped tutor sessions, practicums, and all students in one-on-one classes. Each class section should be counted
only once and should not be duplicated because of course catalog cross-listings.

Class Subsections: A class subsection includes any subsection of a course, such as laboratory, recitation, and discussion
subsections that are supplementary in nature and are scheduled to meet separately from the lecture portion of the course.
Undergraduate subsections are defined as any subsections of courses in which degree-seeking undergraduate students enrolled
for credit. As above, exclude noncredit classes and individual instruction such as dissertation or thesis research, music
instruction, or one-to-one readings. Each class subsection should be counted only once and should not be duplicated because of
cross-listings.

Using the above definitions, please report for each of the following class-size intervals the number of class sections and class
subsections offered in fall 2014. For example, a lecture class with 800 students who met at another time in 40 separate labs with
20 students should be counted once in the “100+” column in the class section column and 40 times under the “20-29” column of
the class subsections table.

                                  J. Disciplinary areas of DEGREES CONFERRED

Degrees conferred between July 1, 2013 and June 30, 2014

For each of the following discipline areas, provide the percentage of diplomas/certificates, associate, and bachelor’s degrees
awarded. To determine the percentage, use majors, not headcount (e.g., students with one degree but a double major will be
represented twice). Calculate the percentage from your institution’s IPEDS Completions by using the sum of 1st and 2nd majors
for each CIP code as the numerator and the sum of the Grand Total by 1st Majors and the Grand Total by 2nd major as the
denominator. If you prefer, you can compute the percentages using 1st majors only.

♦   All definitions related to the financial aid section appear at the end of the Definitions document.

♦   Items proceeded by an asterisk (*) represent definitions agreed to among publishers which do not appear on the CDS
    document but may be present on individual publishers’ surveys.

*Academic advisement: Plan under which each student is assigned to a faculty member or a trained adviser, who, through
regular meetings, helps the student plan and implement immediate and long-term academic and vocational goals.
Accelerated program: Completion of a college program of study in fewer than the usual number of years, most often by
attending summer sessions and carrying extra courses during the regular academic term.
Admitted student: Applicant who is offered admission to a degree-granting program at your institution.

*Adult student services: Admission assistance, support, orientation, and other services expressly for adults who have started
college for the first time, or who are re-entering after a lapse of a few years.
American Indian or Alaska native: A person having origins in any of the original peoples of North America and South
America (including Central America) who maintains cultural identification through tribal affiliation or community recognition.

Applicant (first-time, first year): An individual who has fulfilled the institution’s requirements to be considered for admission
(including payment or waiving of the application fee, if any) and who has been notified of one of the following actions:
admission, nonadmission, placement on waiting list, or application withdrawn (by applicant or institution).

Application fee: That amount of money that an institution charges for processing a student’s application for acceptance. This
amount is not creditable toward tuition and required fees, nor is it refundable if the student is not admitted to the institution.

Asian or Pacific Islander: A person having origins in any of the original peoples of the Far East, Southeast Asia, the Indian
Subcontinent, or Pacific Islands. This includes people from China, Japan, Korea, the Philippine Islands, American Samoa,
India, and Vietnam.

Associate degree: An award that normally requires at least two but less than four years of full-time equivalent college work.

Bachelor’s degree: An award (baccalaureate or equivalent degree, as determined by the Secretary of the U.S. Department of
Education) that normally requires at least four years but not more than five years of full-time equivalent college-level work.
This includes ALL bachelor’s degrees conferred in a five-year cooperative (work-study plan) program. (A cooperative plan
provides for alternate class attendance and employment in business, industry, or government; thus, it allows students to combine
actual work experience with their college studies.) Also, it includes bachelor’s degrees in which the normal four years of work
are completed in three years.

Black, non-Hispanic: A person having origins in any of the black racial groups of Africa (except those of Hispanic origin).

Board (charges): Assume average cost for 19 meals per week or the maximum meal plan.

Books and supplies (costs): Average cost of books and supplies. Do not include unusual costs for special groups of students
