Please refer to the following financial aid definitions when completing Section H.

Awarded aid: The dollar amounts offered to financial aid applicants.

Financial aid applicant: Any applicant who submits any one of the institutionally required financial aid applications/forms,
such as the FAFSA.

Indebtedness: Aggregate dollar amount borrowed through any loan programs (federal, state, subsidized, unsubsidized,
private, etc.; excluding parent loans) while the student was enrolled at an institution. Student loans co-signed by a parent are
assumed to be the responsibility of the student and should be included.

Institutional scholarships and grants: Endowed scholarships, alumni gifts and tuition funded grants for which the institution
determines the recipient.

Financial need: As determined by your institution using the federal methodology and/or your institution's own standards.

Need-based aid: College-funded or college-administered award from institutional, state, federal, or other sources for which a
student must have financial need to qualify. This includes both institutional and noninstitutional student aid (grants, jobs, and
loans).

Need-based scholarship or grant aid: Scholarships and grants from institutional, state, federal, or other sources for which a
student must have financial need to qualify.

Need-based self-help aid: Loans and jobs from institutional, state, federal, or other sources for which a student must
demonstrate financial need to qualify.

Non-need-based scholarship or grant aid: Scholarships and grants, gifts, or merit-based aid from institutional, state, federal,
or other sources (including unrestricted funds or gifts and endowment income) awarded solely on the basis of academic
achievement, merit, or any other non-need-based reason. When reporting questions H1 and H2, non-need-based aid that is
used to meet need should be counted as need-based aid.

    Note: Suggested order of precedence for counting non-need money as need-based:
    Non-need institutional grants
    Non-need tuition waivers
    Non-need athletic awards
    Non-need federal grants
    Non-need state grants
    Non-need outside grants
    Non-need student loans
    Non-need parent loans
    Non-need work

Non-need-based self-help aid: Loans and jobs from institutional, state, or other sources for which a student need not
demonstrate financial need to qualify.

External scholarships and grants: Scholarships and grants received from outside (private) sources that students bring with
them (e.g., Kiwanis, National Merit scholarships). The institution may process paperwork to receive the dollars, but it has no
role in determining the recipient or the dollar amount awarded.

Work study and employment: Federal and state work study aid, and any employment packaged by your institution in
financial aid awards.

Aid Awarded to Enrolled Undergraduates

H1. Enter total dollar amounts awarded to enrolled full-time and less than full-time degree-seeking undergraduates (using
    the same cohort reported in CDS Question B1, “total degree-seeking” undergraduates) in the following categories.
    (Note: If the data being reported are final figures for the 2007-2008 academic year (see the next item below), use the
    2007-2008 academic year's CDS Question B1 cohort.) Include aid awarded to international students (i.e., those not
    qualifying for federal aid). Aid that is non-need-based but that was used to meet need should be reported in the
    need-based aid column. (For a suggested order of precedence in assigning categories of aid to cover need, see the
    entry for “non-need-based scholarship or grant aid” on the last page of the definitions section.)

    Indicate the academic year for which data are reported for items H1, H2, H2A, and H6 below:

H15. If your institution has recently implemented any major financial aid policy, program, or initiative to make
your institution more affordable to incoming students such as replacing loans with grants, or waiving costs for
families below a certain income level please provide details below:

A new initiative will start for 2009-10. It is part of the Commitment to Delawareans that was announced earlier this year. The
goal is to meet the full need of Delawareans, with need calculated based on tuition and fees, on-campus housing, meals, and

freshman only. Once started, it continues for 4 years, with a new freshman class added to it each year.

I-1. Please report the number of instructional faculty members in each category for fall 2008. Include faculty who are
on your institution’s payroll on the census date your institution uses for IPEDS/AAUP.

The following definition of full-time instructional faculty is used by the American Association of University Professors
(AAUP) in its annual Faculty Compensation Survey (the part time definitions are not used by AAUP). Instructional Faculty is
defined as those members of the instructional-research staff whose major regular assignment is instruction, including those
with released time for research. Use the chart below to determine inclusions and exclusions:

                                                                                   Full-time     Part-time

I-2. Student to Faculty Ratio

Report the fall 2008 ratio of full-time equivalent students (full-time plus 1/3 part time) to full-time equivalent instructional
faculty (full time plus 1/3 part time). In the ratio calculations, exclude both faculty and students in stand-alone graduate or
professional programs such as medicine, law, veterinary, dentistry, social work, business, or public health in which faculty
teach virtually only graduate level students. Do not count undergraduate or graduate student teaching assistants as faculty.

Fall 2008 Student to Faculty ratio:      12     to 1 (based on           students and            faculty).




                                                                                                                        Page 26

I-3. Undergraduate Class Size

In the table below, please use the following definitions to report information about the size of classes and class sections offered
in the fall 2008 term.

Class Sections: A class section is an organized course offered for credit, identified by discipline and number, meeting at a
stated time or times in a classroom or similar setting, and not a subsection such as a laboratory or discussion session.
Undergraduate class sections are defined as any sections in which at least one degree-seeking undergraduate student is enrolled
for credit. Exclude distance learning classes and noncredit classes and individual instruction such as dissertation or thesis
research, music instruction, or one-to-one readings. Exclude students in independent study, co-operative programs, internships,
foreign language taped tutor sessions, practicums, and all students in one-on-one classes. Each class section should be counted
only once and should not be duplicated because of course catalog cross-listings.

Class Subsections: A class subsection includes any subsection of a course, such as laboratory, recitation, and discussion
subsections that are supplementary in nature and are scheduled to meet separately from the lecture portion of the course.
Undergraduate subsections are defined as any subsections of courses in which degree-seeking undergraduate students enrolled
for credit. As above, exclude noncredit classes and individual instruction such as dissertation or thesis research, music
instruction, or one-to-one readings. Each class subsection should be counted only once and should not be duplicated because
of cross-listings.

Using the above definitions, please report for each of the following class-size intervals the number of class sections and class
subsections offered in fall 2008. For example, a lecture class with 800 students who met at another time in 40 separate labs
with 20 students should be counted once in the “100+” column in the class section column and 40 times under the “20-29”
column of the class subsections table.

                                 J. Disciplinary areas of DEGREES CONFERRED

Degrees conferred between July 1, 2007 and June 30, 2008

For each of the following discipline areas, provide the percentage of diplomas/certificates, associate, and bachelor’s degrees
awarded. To determine the percentage, use majors, not headcount (e.g., students with one degree but a double major will be
represented twice). Calculate the percentage from your institution’s IPEDS Completions by using the sum of 1st and 2nd majors
for each CIP code as the numerator and the sum of the Grand Total by 1st Majors and the Grand Total by 2nd major as the
denominator. If you prefer, you can compute the percentages using 1st majors only. Percentages use 1st majors only.

assumed to be the responsibility of the student and should be included.

Institutional scholarships and grants: Endowed scholarships, annual gifts and tuition funded grants for which the institution
determines the recipient.

Financial need: As determined by your institution using the federal methodology and/or your institution's own standards.

Need-based aid: College-funded or college-administered award from institutional, state, federal, or other sources for which a
student must have financial need to qualify. This includes both institutional and noninstitutional student aid (grants, jobs, and
loans).

Need-based scholarship or grant aid: Scholarships and grants from institutional, state, federal, or other sources for which a
student must have financial need to qualify.

Need-based self-help aid: Loans and jobs from institutional, state, federal, or other sources for which a student must
demonstrate financial need to qualify.

Non-need-based scholarship or grant aid: Scholarships and grants, gifts, or merit-based aid from institutional, state, federal,
or other sources (including unrestricted funds or gifts and endowment income) awarded solely on the basis of academic
achievement, merit, or any other non-need-based reason. When reporting questions H1 and H2, non-need-based aid that is
used to meet need should be counted as need-based aid.

    Note: Suggested order of precedence for counting non-need money as need-based:
    Non-need institutional grants
    Non-need tuition waivers
    Non-need athletic awards
    Non-need federal grants
    Non-need state grants
    Non-need outside grants
    Non-need student loans
    Non-need parent loans
    Non-need work

Non-need-based self-help aid: Loans and jobs from institutional, state, or other sources for which a student need not
demonstrate financial need to qualify.

Work study and employment: Federal and state work study aid, and any employment packaged by your institution in
financial aid awards.
