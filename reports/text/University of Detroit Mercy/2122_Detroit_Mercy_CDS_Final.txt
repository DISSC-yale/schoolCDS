Graduation Rates
The items in this section correspond to data elements collected by the IPEDS Web-based Data Collection System’s Graduation Rate Survey (GRS). For complete instructions and
definitions of data elements, see the IPEDS GRS Forms and Instructions for the 2021-2022 Survey.

For Bachelor's or Equivalent Programs: In the following section for bachelor’s or equivalent programs, please disaggregate the Fall 2015 and Fall 2015 cohorts (formerly CDS B4-B11)
into four groups:
• Students who received a Federal Pell Grant*
• Recipients of a subsidized Stafford Loan who did not receive a Pell Grant
• Students who did not receive either a Pell Grant or a subsidized Stafford Loan
• Total (all students, regardless of Pell Grant or subsidized loan status)

*Students who received both a Federal Pell Grant and a subsidized Stafford Loan should be reported in the "Recipients of a Federal Pell Grant" column.
For each graduation rate grid below, the numbers in the first three columns for Questions A-G should sum to the cohort total in the fourth column (formerly CDS B4-B11).

Please refer to the following financial aid definitions when completing Section H.
Awarded aid: The dollar amounts offered to financial aid applicants.
Financial aid applicant: Any applicant who submits any one of the institutionally required financial aid applications/forms, such as the FAFSA.
Indebtedness: Aggregate dollar amount borrowed through any loan program (federal, state, subsidized, unsubsidized, private, etc.; excluding parent
loans) while the student was enrolled at an institution. Student loans co-signed by a parent are assumed to be the responsibility of the student and
should be included.
Institutional scholarships and grants: Endowed scholarships, annual gifts and tuition funded grants for which the institution determines the recipient.
Financial need: As determined by your institution using the federal methodology and/or your institution's own standards.
Need-based aid: College-funded or college-administered award from institutional, state, federal, or other sources for which a student must have financial
need to qualify. This includes both institutional and non-institutional student aid (grants, jobs, and loans).
Need-based scholarship or grant aid: Scholarships and grants from institutional, state, federal, or other sources for which a student must have financial
need to qualify.
Need-based self-help aid: Loans and jobs from institutional, state, federal, or other sources for which a student must demonstrate financial need to
qualify.
Non-need-based scholarship or grant aid: Scholarships and grants, gifts, or merit-based aid from institutional, state, federal, or other sources
(including unrestricted funds or gifts and endowment income) awarded solely on the basis of academic achievement, merit, or any other non-need-based
reason. When reporting questions H1 and H2, non-need-based aid that is used to meet need should be counted as need-based aid.
          Note: Suggested order of precedence for counting non-need money as need-based:
            1. Non-need institutional grants                                           6. Non-need outside grants
            2. Non-need tuition waivers                                                7. Non-need student loans
            3. Non-need athletic awards                                                8. Non-need parent loans
            4. Non-need federal grants                                                 9. Non-need work
            5. Non-need state grants
Non-need-based self-help aid: Loans and jobs from institutional, state, or other sources for which a student need not demonstrate financial need to
qualify.
Private student loans: A nonfederal loan made by a lender such as a bank, credit union or private lender used to pay for up to the annual cost of
education, less any financial aid received.
External scholarships and grants: Scholarships and grants received from outside (private) sources that students bring with them (e.g., Kiwanis,
National Merit scholarships). The institution may process paperwork to receive the dollars, but it has no role in determining the recipient or the dollar
amount awarded.
Work study and employment: Federal and state work study aid, and any employment packaged by your institution in financial aid awards.

                           DO NOT INCLUDE ANY AID RELATED TO THE CARES ACT OR UNIQUE TO THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC
Aid Awarded to Enrolled Undergraduates
Enter total dollar amounts awarded to enrolled full-time and less than full-time degree-seeking undergraduates (using the same cohort reported in
CDS Question B1, “total degree-seeking” undergraduates) in the following categories.
   • If the data being reported are final figures for the 2020-2021 academic year (see the next item below), use the 2020-2021 academic year's CDS
   Question B1 cohort.
   • Include aid awarded to international students (i.e., those not qualifying for federal aid).
   • Aid that is non-need-based but that was used to meet need should be reported in the need-based aid column.
   • For a suggested order of precedence in assigning categories of aid to cover need, see the entry for “non-need-based scholarship or grant aid” on
   the last page of the definitions section.
   •     Do NOT include any aid related to the CARES Act or unique to the COVID-19 pandemic.

     In the 2018-19 academic year Detroit Mercy implemented a tuition reset for full-time undergraduate students. For
     the average full-time undergraduate tuition was reduced from $41,158 to $28,000 per year. Students are still eligible
 H15 for institutional grants and scholarships. This reduction has proportionally reduced the overall awards in each
     category above.

    research staff whose major regular assignment is instruction, including those with released time for research. Use the chart below to determine
    inclusions and exclusions:

    or other Pacific Islander, or Hispanic.

    Doctorate: includes such degrees as Doctor of Philosophy, Doctor of Education, Doctor of Juridical Science, and Doctor of Public Health in any
    field such as arts, sciences, education, engineering, business, and public administration. Also includes terminal degrees formerly designated as
    “first professional,” including dentistry (DDS or DMD), medicine (MD), optometry (OD), osteopathic medicine (DO), pharmacy (DPharm or
    BPharm), podiatric medicine (DPM), veterinary medicine (DVM), chiropractic (DC or DCM), or law (JD).

   Student to Faculty Ratio
   Report the Fall 2021 ratio of full-time equivalent students (full-time plus 1/3 part time) to full-time equivalent instructional faculty
   (full time plus 1/3 part time). In the ratio calculations, exclude both faculty and students in stand-alone graduate or professional
   programs such as medicine, law, veterinary, dentistry, social work, business, or public health in which faculty teach virtually only
   graduate-level students.

        • Do not count undergraduate or graduate student teaching assistants as faculty.

   Fall 2011 Student to Faculty ratio:                         11        to 1        (based on           3,233         FTE students

   Undergraduate Class Size
   In the table below, please use the following definitions to report information about the size of classes and class sections offered
   in the Fall 2021 term.

   Class Sections: A class section is an organized course offered for credit, identified by discipline and number, meeting at a
   stated time or times in a classroom or similar setting, and not a subsection such as a laboratory or discussion session.
   Undergraduate class sections are defined as any sections in which at least one degree-seeking undergraduate student is
   enrolled for credit. Exclude distance learning classes and noncredit classes and individual instruction such as dissertation or
   thesis research, music instruction, or one-to-one readings. Exclude students in independent study, co-operative programs,
   internships, foreign language taped tutor sessions, practicums, and all students in one-on-one classes. Each class section
   should be counted only once and should not be duplicated because of course catalog cross-listings.

   Class Subsections: A class subsection includes any subsection of a course, such as laboratory, recitation, and discussion
   subsections that are supplementary in nature and are scheduled to meet separately from the lecture portion of the course.
   Undergraduate subsections are defined as any subsections of courses in which degree-seeking undergraduate students
   enrolled for credit. As above, exclude noncredit classes and individual instruction such as dissertation or thesis research, music
I3
   instruction, or one-to-one readings. Each class subsection should be counted only once and should not be duplicated because
   of cross-listings.

   Using the above definitions, please report for each of the following class-size intervals the number of class sections and class
   subsections offered in Fall 2020. For example, a lecture class with 800 students who met at another time in 40 separate labs
   with 20 students should be counted once in the “100+” column in the class section column and 40 times under the “20-29”
   column of the class subsections table.

     Degrees conferred between July 1, 2020 and June 30, 2021
     For each of the following discipline areas, provide the percentage of diplomas/certificates, associate, and bachelor’s degrees awarded. To determine the
     percentage, use majors, not headcount (e.g., students with one degree but a double major will be represented twice). Calculate the percentage from your
     institution’s IPEDS Completions by using the sum of 1st and 2nd majors for each CIP code as the numerator and the sum of the Grand Total by 1st Majors and the
     Grand Total by 2nd major as the denominator. If you prefer, you can compute the percentages using 1st majors only.
