     B4-B21: Graduation Rates
     The items in this section correspond to data elements collected by the IPEDS Web-based Data Collection
     System’s Graduation Rate Survey (GRS).

     •   For complete instructions and definitions of data elements, see the IPEDS GRS Forms and Instructions
         for the 2020-2021 Survey. https://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/use-the-data/survey-components/9/graduation-rates

     In the following section for bachelor’s or equivalent programs, please disaggregate the Fall 2013 and
     Fall 2014 cohorts (formerly CDS B4-B11) into four groups:
     • Students who received a Federal Pell Grant*
     • Recipients of a subsidized Stafford Loan who did not receive a Pell Grant
     • Students who did not receive either a Pell Grant or a subsidized Stafford Loan
     • Total (all students, regardless of Pell Grant or subsidized loan status)

     *Students who received both a Federal Pell Grant and a subsidized Stafford Loan should be reported in the
     "Recipients of a Federal Pell Grant" column.

     For each graduation rate grid below, the numbers in the first three columns for Questions A-G should sum to
     the cohort total in the fourth column (formerly CDS B4-B11).
                                           For Bachelor’s or Equivalent Programs

     Please provide data for the Fall 2014 cohort if available. If Fall 2014 cohort data are not available, provide
     data for the Fall 2013 cohort.

     least one degree-seeking undergraduate student is enrolled for credit. Exclude distance learning classes
     and noncredit classes and individual instruction such as dissertation or thesis research, music instruction,
     or one-to-one readings. Exclude students in independent study, co-operative programs, internships, foreign
     language taped tutor sessions, practicums, and all students in one-on-one classes. Each class section
     should be counted only once and should not be duplicated because of course catalog cross-listings.

     Class Subsections: A class subsection includes any subsection of a course, such as laboratory,
     recitation, and discussion subsections that are supplementary in nature and are scheduled to meet
     separately from the lecture portion of the course. Undergraduate subsections are defined as any
     subsections of courses in which degree-seeking undergraduate students enrolled for credit. As above,
     exclude noncredit classes and individual instruction such as dissertation or thesis research, music
     instruction, or one-to-one readings. Each class subsection should be counted only once and should not be
     duplicated because of cross-listings.
     Using the above definitions, please report for each of the following class-size intervals the number of class
     sections and class subsections offered in Fall 2020. For example, a lecture class with 800 students who
     met at another time in 40 separate labs with 20 students should be counted once in the “100+” column in
     the class section column and 40 times under the “20-29” column of the class subsections table.

                                     J. Disciplinary areas of DEGREES CONFERRED
J1   Degrees conferred between July 1, 2019 and June 30, 2020
     For each of the following discipline areas, provide the percentage of diplomas/certificates, associate, and bachelor’s degrees awarded. To
     determine the percentage, use majors, not headcount (e.g., students with one degree but a double major will be represented twice).
     Calculate the percentage from your institution’s IPEDS Completions by using the sum of 1st and 2nd majors for each CIP code as the
     numerator and the sum of the Grand Total by 1st Majors and the Grand Total by 2nd major as the denominator. If you prefer, you can
     compute the percentages using 1st majors only.

    All definitions related to the financial aid section appear at the end of the Definitions document.

    Items preceded by an asterisk (*) represent definitions agreed to among publishers which do not appear on the CDS document but
may be present on individual publishers’ surveys.

*Academic advisement: Plan under which each student is assigned to a faculty member or a trained adviser, who, through regular
meetings, helps the student plan and implement immediate and long-term academic and vocational goals.
Accelerated program: Completion of a college program of study in fewer than the usual number of years, most often by attending
summer sessions and carrying extra courses during the regular academic term.
Admitted student: Applicant who is offered admission to a degree-granting program at your institution.

*Adult student services: Admission assistance, support, orientation, and other services expressly for adults who have started college
for the first time, or who are re-entering after a lapse of a few years.
American Indian or Alaska Native: A person having origins in any of the original peoples of North and South America (including
Central America) and maintaining tribal affiliation or community attachment.
Applicant (first-time, first year): An individual who has fulfilled the institution’s requirements to be considered for admission
(including payment or waiving of the application fee, if any) and who has been notified of one of the following actions: admission,
nonadmission, placement on waiting list, or application withdrawn (by applicant or institution).
Application fee: That amount of money that an institution charges for processing a student’s application for acceptance. This amount
is not creditable toward tuition and required fees, nor is it refundable if the student is not admitted to the institution.

Bachelor’s degree: An award (baccalaureate or equivalent degree, as determined by the Secretary of the U.S. Department of
Education) that normally requires at least four years but not more than five years of full-time equivalent college-level work. This
includes ALL bachelor’s degrees conferred in a five-year cooperative (work-study plan) program. (A cooperative plan provides for
alternate class attendance and employment in business, industry, or government; thus, it allows students to combine actual work
experience with their college studies.) Also, it includes bachelor’s degrees in which the normal four years of work are completed in
three years.
Black or African American: A person having origins in any of the black racial groups of Africa.
Board (charges): Assume average cost for 19 meals per week or the maximum meal plan.

engineering or art majors), unless they constitute the majority of students at your institution.
Calendar system: The method by which an institution structures most of its courses for the academic year.
Campus Ministry: Religious student organizations (denominational or nondenominational) devoted to fostering religious life on
college campuses. May also refer to Campus Crusade for Christ, an interdenominational Christian organization.

*Career and placement services: A range of services, including (often) the following: coordination of visits of employers to campus;
aptitude and vocational testing; interest inventories, personal counseling; help in resume writing, interviewing, launching the job

folder; career resource materials.
Carnegie units: One year of study or the equivalent in a secondary school subject.
Certificate: See Postsecondary award, certificate, or diploma.
Class rank: The relative numerical position of a student in his or her graduating class, calculated by the high school on the basis of
grade-point average, whether weighted or unweighted.
College-preparatory program: Courses in academic subjects (English, history and social studies, foreign languages, mathematics,
