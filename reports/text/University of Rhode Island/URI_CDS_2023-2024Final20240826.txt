B2   Enrollment by Racial/Ethnic Category.
     Provide numbers of undergraduate students for each of the following categories as of the institution’s official fall reporting date or as of October 15, 2023.

     •   Include international students only in the category "Nonresidents."
     •   Complete the “Total Undergraduates” column only if you cannot provide data for the first two columns.
     •   Report as your institution reports to IPEDS: persons who are Hispanic should be reported only on the
         Hispanic line, not under any race, and persons who are non-Hispanic multi-racial should be reported only
         under "Two or more races."
     •   New guidance from IPEDS for reporting aggregate data:
     Racial/ethnic designations are requested only for United States citizens, residents, and other eligible non-citizens.
     Eligible non-citizens include all students who completed high school or a GED equivalency within the United States
     (including DACA and undocumented students) and who were not on an F-1 non-immigrant student visa at the time of
     high school graduation.
     More information about other eligible (for financial aid purposes) non-citizens is available at
     https://studentaid.gov/understandaid/eligibility/requirements/non-us-citizens.

     Nonresident - A person who is not a citizen or national of the United States and who is in this country on a student visa
     or temporary basis and does not have the right to remain indefinitely. Do not include DACA, undocumented, or other
     eligible noncitizens in this category.

     NOTE - Nonresidents are to be reported separately, in the boxes provided, rather than included in any of the seven
     racial/ethnic categories or in race/ethnicity unknown.

      Report for the cohort of all full-time, first-time bachelor’s (or equivalent) degree-seeking undergraduate students who entered in Fall 2022 (or the preceding
      summer term).
      • The initial cohort may be adjusted for students who departed for the following reasons:
      * Death
      * Permanent Disability
      * Service in the armed forces
      * Foreign aid service of the federal government
      * Official church missions
      * No other adjustments to the initial cohort should be made.

B22 For the cohort of all full-time bachelor’s (or equivalent) degree-seeking undergraduate students who entered your
    institution as first-year students in Fall 2022 (or the preceding summer term), what percentage was enrolled at your
    institution as of the date your institution calculates its official enrollment in Fall 2023.                                         84.1%

       Total students retained = students from the Fall 2022 cohort who are still enrolled as of Fall 2023 +
       students from Fall 2022 cohort who completed their bachelor’s program as of Fall 2023

       (Students from the Fall 2022 cohort still enrolled as of Fall 2023 + Students from Fall 2022 cohort
       who completed their bachelor’s program as of Fall 2023)/(Adjusted Fall 2022 cohort) *100

       Note: The number of first-time students seeking a bachelor’s degree (or equivalent) who attain a
       bachelor’s degree (or equivalent) by their second fall term is expected to be zero or very small. In
       exceptional cases when a first-time student does satisfy all degree requirements including full
       credit completion (e.g., typically 120 credit hours) and is awarded a bachelor’s degree (or
       equivalent) by their second fall term, they are to be considered “retained” for EF reporting
       purposes.

                                           H. FINANCIAL AID
     Please refer to the following financial aid definitions when completing Section H.
     Awarded aid: The dollar amounts offered to financial aid applicants.
     Financial aid applicant: Any applicant who submits any one of the institutionally required financial aid
     applications/forms, such as the FAFSA.
     Indebtedness: Aggregate dollar amount borrowed through any loan program (federal, state, subsidized,
     unsubsidized, private, etc.; excluding parent loans) while the student was enrolled at an institution. Student
     loans co-signed by a parent are assumed to be the responsibility of the student and should be included.
     Institutional scholarships and grants: Endowed scholarships, annual gifts and tuition funded grants for
     which the institution determines the recipient.
     Financial need: As determined by your institution using the federal methodology and/or your institution's
     own standards.
     Need-based aid: College-funded or college-administered award from institutional, state, federal, or other
     sources for which a student must have financial need to qualify. This includes both institutional and non-
     institutional student aid (grants, jobs, and loans).
     Need-based scholarship or grant aid: Scholarships and grants from institutional, state, federal, or other
     sources for which a student must have financial need to qualify.
     Need-based self-help aid: Loans and jobs from institutional, state, federal, or other sources for which a
     student must demonstrate financial need to qualify.
     Non-need-based scholarship or grant aid: Scholarships and grants, gifts, or merit-based aid from
     institutional, state, federal, or other sources (including unrestricted funds or gifts and endowment income)
     awarded solely on the basis of academic achievement, merit, or any other non-need-based reason. When
     reporting questions H1 and H2, non-need-based aid that is used to meet need should be counted as need-
     based aid.
     Note: Suggested order of precedence for counting non-need money as need-based:
        1. Non-need institutional grants                         6. Non-need outside grants
        2. Non-need tuition waivers                              7. Non-need student loans
        3. Non-need athletic awards                              8. Non-need parent loans
        4. Non-need federal grants                               9. Non-need work
        5. Non-need state grants
     Non-need-based self-help aid: Loans and jobs from institutional, state, or other sources for which a
     student need not demonstrate financial need to qualify.
     Private student loans: A nonfederal loan made by a lender such as a bank, credit union or private lender
     used to pay for up to the annual cost of education, less any financial aid received.
     External scholarships and grants: Scholarships and grants received from outside (private) sources that
     students bring with them (e.g., Kiwanis, National Merit scholarships). The institution may process
     paperwork to receive the dollars, but it has no role in determining the recipient or the dollar amount
     Work study and employment: Federal and state work study aid, and any employment packaged by your
     institution in financial aid awards.

     DO NOT INCLUDE ANY AID RELATED TO THE CARES ACT OR UNIQUE THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC

     Aid Awarded to Enrolled Undergraduates

I-1. Please report the number of instructional faculty members in each category for Fall 2023. Include
     faculty who are on your institution’s payroll on the census date your institution uses for
     IPEDS/AAUP.
       The following definition of full-time instructional faculty is used by the American Association of University Professors
       (AAUP) in its annual Faculty Compensation Survey (the part time definitions are not used by AAUP). Instructional
       Faculty is defined as those members of the instructional-research staff whose major regular assignment is instruction,
       including those with released time for research. Use the chart below to determine inclusions and exclusions:

I-3. Undergraduate Class Size
     In the table below, please use the following definitions to report information about the size of classes and
     class sections offered in the Fall 2023 term.
     • Please include classes that have been moved online in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

     Class Sections: A class section is an organized course offered for credit, identified by discipline and
     number, meeting at a stated time or times in a classroom or similar setting, and not a subsection such as a
     laboratory or discussion session. Undergraduate class sections are defined as any sections in which at
     least one degree-seeking undergraduate student is enrolled for credit. Exclude distance learning classes
     and noncredit classes and individual instruction such as dissertation or thesis research, music instruction,
     or one-to-one readings. Exclude students in independent study, co-operative programs, internships, foreign
     language taped tutor sessions, practicums, and all students in one-on-one classes. Each class section
     should be counted only once and should not be duplicated because of course catalog cross-listings.

     Class Subsections: A class subsection includes any subsection of a course, such as laboratory,
     recitation, and discussion subsections that are supplementary in nature and are scheduled to meet
     separately from the lecture portion of the course. Undergraduate subsections are defined as any
     subsections of courses in which degree-seeking undergraduate students enrolled for credit. As above,
     exclude noncredit classes and individual instruction such as dissertation or thesis research, music
     instruction, or one-to-one readings. Each class subsection should be counted only once and should not be
     duplicated because of cross-listings.
     Using the above definitions, please report for each of the following class-size intervals the number of class
     sections and class subsections offered in Fall 2023. For example, a lecture class with 800 students who
     met at another time in 40 separate labs with 20 students should be counted once in the “100+” column in
     the class section column and 40 times under the “20-29” column of the class subsections table.

                                     J. Disciplinary areas of DEGREES CONFERRED
J1   Degrees conferred between July 1, 2022 and June 30, 2023
     For each of the following discipline areas, provide the percentage of diplomas/certificates, associate, and bachelor’s degrees awarded. To
     determine the percentage, use majors, not headcount (e.g., students with one degree but a double major will be represented twice).
     Calculate the percentage from your institution’s IPEDS Completions by using the sum of 1st and 2nd majors for each CIP code as the
     numerator and the sum of the Grand Total by 1st Majors and the Grand Total by 2nd major as the denominator. If you prefer, you can
     compute the percentages using 1st majors only.

External scholarships and grants: Scholarships and grants received from outside (private) sources that students bring with them (e.g., Kiwanis, National M erit scholarships).

Indebtedness: Aggregate dollar amount borrowed through any loan program (federal, state, subsidized, unsubsidized, private, etc.; excluding parent loans) while the student was enrolled at an institution. Student loans co-signed by a parent are assumed to be the responsibility of the student and should be included.

Institutional scholarships and grants: Endowed scholarships, annual gifts and tuition funded grants for which the institution determines the recipient.

Financial need: As determined by your institution using the federal methodology and/or your institution's own standards.
