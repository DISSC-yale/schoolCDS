                                     CHANGES TO THE CDS FOR 2003-2004


NEW ITEMS

A0.        Respondent Information: This item collects respondent name and contact information in case questions arise.
           (This information will not be published.) It also requests the Web address of CDSs posted online for use by data
           collectors.

CHANGED ITEMS

B4. - B21. Graduation Rates: Bachelor’s or equivalent program data may be provided for the fall 1997 cohort else the fall
           1996 cohort depending upon the timing of the data request and the availability of the data. Likewise for two-year
           institutions, data may be provided for the 2000 cohort else the 1999 cohort.
E4. - E8. Library Collections: This item now references questions and definitions used in the most recent Academic
           Libraries Survey.
H.         Financial Aid:
           • Questions were reworded slightly for clarification. The term “gift aid” was replaced with “scholarship or
                grant aid” and “received” was replaced with “awarded.”
           • In H1, the row heading “State (Scholarship/Grants)” was defined to include scholarships and grants from all
                states, not only the state in which your institution is located.
           • In H2b, the question was refined to include only students who applied for need-based financial aid.
           • In H2i, financial aid awarded in excess of need is to be excluded.
           • H2A “Number of Enrolled Students Awarded Non-need-based Scholarships and Grants” was refined to
                include only institutional aid.
J.         Degrees Conferred: CIP 2000’s two-digit categories are now listed alongside those for CIP 1990.

Provide 2004-2005 academic year costs of attendance for the following categories that are applicable to your
institution.

URI tuition and fees are set by the state legislature and are not available for 2004-05 until after July 1, 2004.

G1. Undergraduate full-time tuition, required fees, room and board (actual 2003-04 figures are included below)
    List the typical tuition, required fees, and room and board for a full-time undergraduate student for the FULL 2004-2005
    academic year (30 semester hours or 45 quarter hours for institutions that derive annual tuition by multiplying credit
    hour cost by number of credits). A full academic year refers to the period of time generally extending from September to
    June; usually equated to two semesters, two trimesters, three quarters, or the period covered by a four-one-four plan.
    Room and board is defined as double occupancy and 19 meals per week or the maximum meal plan. Required fees
    include only charges that all full-time students must pay that are not included in tuition (e.g., registration, health, or
    activity fees.) Do not include optional fees (e.g., parking, laboratory use).

                                                   H. FINANCIAL AID

Please refer to the following financial aid definitions when completing Section H.

Financial aid applicant: Any applicant who submits any one of the institutionally required financial aid applications/forms,
such as the FAFSA.

Indebtedness: Aggregate dollar amount borrowed through any loan programs (federal, state, subsidized, unsubsidized,
private, etc.; excluding parent loans) while the student was enrolled at an institution. Student loans co-signed by a parent are
assumed to be the responsibility of the student and should be included.

Institutional and external funds: Endowment, alumni, or external monies for which the institution determines the recipient
or the dollar amount awarded.

Financial need: As determined by your institution using the federal methodology and/or your institution's own standards.

Need-based aid: College-funded or college-administered award from institutional, state, federal, or other sources for which
a student must have financial need to qualify. This includes both institutional and noninstitutional student aid (grants, jobs,
and loans).

Need-based scholarship or grant aid: Scholarships and grants from institutional, state, federal, or other sources for which a
student must have financial need to qualify.

Need-based self-help aid: Loans and jobs from institutional, state, federal, or other sources for which a student must
demonstrate financial need to qualify.

Non-need-based scholarship or grant aid: Scholarships and grants, gifts, or merit-based aid from institutional, state,
federal, or other sources (including unrestricted funds or gifts and endowment income) awarded solely on the basis of
academic achievement, merit, or any other non-need-based reason. When reporting questions H1 and H2, non-need-based
aid that is used to meet need should be counted as need-based aid.

    Note: Suggested order of precedence for counting non-need money as need-based:
    Non-need institutional grants
    Non-need tuition waivers
    Non-need athletic awards
    Non-need federal grants
    Non-need state grants
    Non-need outside grants
    Non-need student loans
    Non-need parent loans
    Non-need work

Non-need-based self-help aid: Loans and jobs from institutional, state, or other sources for which a student need not
demonstrate financial need to qualify.

Scholarships/grants from external sources: Monies received from outside (private) sources that the student brings with
them (e.g., Kiwanis, National Merit scholarships). The institution may process paperwork to receive the dollars, but it has no
role in determining the recipient or the dollar amount awarded.

Work study and employment: Federal and state work study aid, and any employment packaged by your institution in
financial aid awards.

Aid Awarded to Enrolled Undergraduates

H1. Enter total dollar amounts awarded to enrolled full-time and less than full-time degree-seeking undergraduates (using
    the same cohort reported in CDS Question B1, “total degree-seeking” undergraduates) in the following categories.
    (Note: If the data being reported are final figures for the 2002-2003 academic year (see the next item below), use the
    2002-2003 academic year's CDS Question B1 cohort.) Include aid awarded to international students (i.e., those not
    qualifying for federal aid). Aid that is non-need-based but that was used to meet need should be reported in the
    need-based aid column. (For a suggested order of precedence in assigning categories of aid to cover need, see the
    entry for “non-need-based scholarship or grant aid” on the last page of the definitions section.)

    Indicate the academic year for which data are reported for items H1, H2, H2A, and H6 below:

I-1. Please report the number of instructional faculty members in each category for Fall 2003.

The following definition of instructional faculty is used by the American Association of University Professors (AAUP) in its
annual Faculty Compensation Survey. Instructional Faculty is defined as those members of the instructional-research staff
whose major regular assignment is instruction, including those with released time for research. Institutions are asked to
EXCLUDE:
(a) instructional faculty in preclinical and clinical medicine
(b) administrative officers with titles such as dean of students, librarian, registrar, coach, and the like, even though they may
devote part of their time to classroom instruction and may have faculty status,
(c) undergraduate or graduate students who assist in the instruction of courses, but have titles such as teaching assistant,
teaching fellow, and the like
(d) faculty on leave without pay, and
(e) replacement faculty for faculty on sabbatical leave.

Full-time: faculty employed on a full-time basis
Part-time: faculty teaching less than two semesters, three quarters, two trimesters, or two four-month sessions. Also includes
adjuncts and part-time instructors.
Minority faculty: includes faculty who designate themselves as black, non-Hispanic; American Indian or Alaskan native;
Asian or Pacific Islander; or Hispanic.
Doctorate: includes such degrees as Doctor of Education, Doctor of Juridical Science, Doctor of Public Health, and Doctor
of Philosophy degree in any field such as agronomy, food technology, education, engineering, public administration,
ophthalmology, or radiology.
First-professional: includes the fields of dentistry (DDS or DMD), medicine (MD), optometry (OD), osteopathic medicine
(DO), pharmacy (DPharm or BPharm), podiatric medicine (DPM), veterinary medicine (DVM), chiropractic (DC or DCM),
law (JD) and theological professions (MDiv, MHL).
Terminal degree: the highest degree in a field: example, M. Arch (architecture) and MFA (master of fine arts).

I-2. Student to Faculty Ratio

Report the Fall 2003 ratio of full-time equivalent students (full-time plus 1/3 part time) to full-time equivalent instructional
faculty (full time plus 1/3 part time). In the ratio calculations, exclude both faculty and students in stand-alone graduate or
professional programs such as medicine, law, veterinary, dentistry, social work, business, or public health in which faculty
teach virtually only graduate level students. Do not count undergraduate or graduate student teaching assistants as faculty.

Fall 2003 Student to Faculty ratio: 18 to 1.

                                               Common Data Set 2003-2004

I-3. Undergraduate Class Size

In the table below, please use the following definitions to report information about the size of classes and class sections
offered in the Fall 2003 term.

Class Sections: A class section is an organized course offered for credit, identified by discipline and number, meeting at a
stated time or times in a classroom or similar setting, and not a subsection such as a laboratory or discussion session.
Undergraduate class sections are defined as any sections in which at least one degree-seeking undergraduate student is
enrolled for credit. Exclude distance learning classes and noncredit classes and individual instruction such as dissertation or
thesis research, music instruction, or one-to-one readings. Exclude students in independent study, co-operative programs,
internships, foreign language taped tutor sessions, practicums, and all students in one-on-one classes. Each class section
should be counted only once and should not be duplicated because of course catalog cross-listings.

Class Subsections: A class subsection includes any subsection of a course, such as laboratory, recitation, and discussion
subsections that are supplementary in nature and are scheduled to meet separately from the lecture portion of the course.
Undergraduate subsections are defined as any subsections of courses in which degree-seeking undergraduate students
enrolled for credit. As above, exclude noncredit classes and individual instruction such as dissertation or thesis research,
music instruction, or one-to-one readings. Each class subsection should be counted only once and should not be duplicated
because of cross-listings.

Using the above definitions, please report for each of the following class-size intervals the number of class sections and

such as the FAFSA.

Indebtedness: Aggregate dollar amount borrowed through any loan programs (federal, state, subsidized, unsubsidized,
private, etc.; excluding parent loans) while the student was enrolled at an institution. Student loans co-signed by a parent are
assumed to be the responsibility of the student and should be included.

Institutional and external funds: Endowment, alumni, or external monies for which the institution determines the recipient
or the dollar amount awarded.

Financial need: As determined by your institution using the federal methodology and/or your institution's own standards.

Need-based aid: College-funded or college-administered award from institutional, state, federal, or other sources for which
a student must have financial need to qualify. This includes both institutional and noninstitutional student aid (grants, jobs,
and loans).

Need-based scholarship or grant aid: Scholarships and grants from institutional, state, federal, or other sources for which a
student must have financial need to qualify.

Need-based self-help aid: Loans and jobs from institutional, state, federal, or other sources for which a student must

federal, or other sources (including unrestricted funds or gifts and endowment income) awarded solely on the basis of
academic achievement, merit, or any other non-need-based reason. When reporting questions H1 and H2, non-need-based
aid that is used to meet need should be counted as need-based aid.

    Note: Suggested order of precedence for counting non-need money as need-based:
    Non-need institutional grants
    Non-need tuition waivers
    Non-need athletic awards
    Non-need federal grants
    Non-need state grants
    Non-need outside grants
    Non-need student loans
    Non-need parent loans
    Non-need work

Non-need-based self-help aid: Loans and jobs from institutional, state, or other sources for which a student need not
demonstrate financial need to qualify.

Scholarships/grants from external sources: Monies received from outside (private) sources that the student brings with
them (e.g., Kiwanis, National Merit scholarships). The institution may process paperwork to receive the dollars, but it has no
role in determining the recipient or the dollar amount awarded.

Work study and employment: Federal and state work study aid, and any employment packaged by your institution in
financial aid awards.
