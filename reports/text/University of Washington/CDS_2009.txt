   Provide 2010-2011 academic year costs of attendance for the following categories that are applicable to your institution.

    CDS G1 (fr). Undergraduate full-time tuition, required fees, room and board. (If costs vary by class, provide Freshman costs.)

                 List the typical tuition, required fees, and room and board for a full-time undergraduate student for the FULL 2010-2011
                 academic year (30 semester hours or 45 quarter hours for institutions that derive annual tuition by multiplying credit
                 hour cost by number of credits). A full academic year refers to the period of time generally extending from September to
                 June; usually equated to two semesters, two trimesters, three quarters, or the period covered by a four-one-four plan.
                 Room and board is defined as double occupancy and 19 meals per week or the maximum meal plan.

                 Required fees include only charges that all full-time students must pay that are not included in tuition (e.g., registration,
                 health, or activity fees). Do not include optional fees (e.g., parking, laboratory use).

                 [Required fees should not include application and orientation fees.]

                          Tuition and fees provided are firm and final for Fall 2010-2011.

   institution's payroll on the census date your institution uses for IPEDS/AAUP.

                  (AAUP) in its annual Faculty Compensation Survey (the part time definitions are not used by AAUP). Instructional

       CDS I3. Undergraduate Class Size

               In the table below, please use the following definitions to report information about the size of classes and class sections
               offered in the Fall 2009 term.

               Class Sections: A class section is an organized course offered for credit, identified by discipline and number, meeting
               at a stated time or times in a classroom or similar setting, and not a subsection such as a laboratory or discussion
               session. Undergraduate class sections are defined as any sections in which at least one degree-seeking undergraduate
               student is enrolled for credit. Exclude distance learning classes and noncredit classes and individual instruction such as
               dissertation or thesis research, music instruction, or one-to-one readings. Exclude students in independent study, co-
               operative programs, internships, foreign language taped tutor sessions, practicums, and all students in one-on-one
               classes. Each class section should be counted only once and should not be duplicated because of course catalog
               cross-listings.

               Class Subsections: A class subsection includes any subsection of a course, such as laboratory, recitation, and
               discussion subsections that are supplementary in nature and are scheduled to meet separately from the lecture portion
               of the course. Undergraduate subsections are defined as any subsections of courses in which degree-seeking
               undergraduate students enrolled for credit. As above, exclude noncredit classes and individual instruction such as
               dissertation or thesis research, music instruction, or one-to-one readings. Each class subsection should be counted
               only once and should not be duplicated because of cross-listings.

               Using the above definitions, please report for each of the following class-size intervals the number of class sections and
               class subsections offered in Fall 2009. For example, a lecture class with 800 students who met at another time in 40
               separate labs with 20 students should be counted once in the "100+" column in the class section column and 40 times
               under the "20-29" column of the class subsections table.

               Number of Class Sections with Undergraduates Enrolled.

   J. Degrees Offered and Awarded
         CDS J. Disciplinary areas of DEGREES CONFERRED

               Degrees conferred between July 1, 2008 and June 30, 2009

               For each of the following discipline areas, provide the percentage of diplomas/certificates, associate, and bachelor's
               degrees awarded. To determine the percentage, use majors, not headcount (e.g., students with one degree but a
               double major will be represented twice). Calculate the percentage from your institution's IPEDS Completions by using
               the sum of 1st and 2nd majors for each CIP code as the numerator and the sum of the Grand Total by 1st majors and
               the Grand Total by 2nd major as the denominator. If you prefer, you can compute the percentages using 1st majors
               only.

               Please note that the only certificate reported in the Degrees Conferred chart below is the certificate below the Associate
               degree. Any/all other certificates (i.e., Postbachelor's certificate, Post-master's certificate) should not be reported in this
               chart.
