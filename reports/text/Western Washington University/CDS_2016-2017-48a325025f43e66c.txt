G1 Undergraduate full-time tuition, required fees, room and board List the typical tuition, required
   fees, and room and board for a full-time undergraduate student for the FULL 2017-2018 academic
   year (30 semester or 45 quarter hours for institutions that derive annual tuition by multiplying
   credit hour cost by number of credits). A full academic year refers to the period of time generally
   extending from September to June; usually equated to two semesters, two trimesters, three
   quarters, or the period covered by a four-one-four plan. Room and board is defined as double
   occupancy and 19 meals per week or the maximum meal plan. Required fees include only
   charges that all full-time students must pay that are not included in tuition (e.g., registration,
   health, or activity fees.) Do not include optional fees (e.g., parking, laboratory use).

     Aid Awarded to Enrolled Undergraduates
     Enter total dollar amounts awarded to enrolled full-time and less than full-time degree-seeking
     undergraduates (using the same cohort reported in CDS Question B1, “total degree-seeking”
     undergraduates) in the following categories. (Note: If the data being reported are final figures for the 2015-
     2016 academic year (see the next item below), use the 2015-2016 academic year's CDS Question B1
     cohort.) Include aid awarded to international students (i.e., those not qualifying for federal aid). Aid that is
     non-need-based but that was used to meet need should be reported in the need-based aid columns. (For
     a suggested order of precedence in assigning categories of aid to cover need, see the entry for “non-
     need-based scholarship or grant aid” on the last page of the definitions section.)

I3   Undergraduate Class Size
     In the table below, please use the following definitions to report information about the size of classes and
     class sections offered in the Fall 2016 term.
     Class Sections: A class section is an organized course offered for credit, identified by discipline and
     number, meeting at a stated time or times in a classroom or similar setting, and not a subsection such as
     a laboratory or discussion session. Undergraduate class sections are defined as any sections in which at
     least one degree-seeking undergraduate student is enrolled for credit. Exclude distance learning classes
     and noncredit classes and individual instruction such as dissertation or thesis research, music instruction,
     or one-to-one readings. Exclude students in independent study, co-operative programs, internships,
     foreign language taped tutor sessions, practicums, and all students in one-on-one classes. Each class
     section should be counted only once and should not be duplicated because of course catalog cross-
     listings.
     Class Subsections: A class subsection includes any subsection of a course, such as laboratory,
     recitation, and discussion subsections that are supplementary in nature and are scheduled to meet
     separately from the lecture portion of the course. Undergraduate subsections are defined as any
     subsections of courses in which degree-seeking undergraduate students enrolled for credit. As above,
     exclude noncredit classes and individual instruction such as dissertation or thesis research, music
     instruction, or one-to-one readings. Each class subsection should be counted only once and should not
     be duplicated because of cross-listings.
     Using the above definitions, please report for each of the following class-size intervals the number of
     class sections and class subsections offered in Fall 2016. For example, a lecture class with 800 students
     who met at another time in 40 separate labs with 20 students should be counted once in the “100+”
     column in the class section column and 40 times under the “20-29” column of the class subsections table.

                                          J. DEGREES CONFERRED
J1 Degrees conferred between July 1, 2015 and June 30, 2016
J1 For each of the following discipline areas, provide the percentage of diplomas/certificates, associate, and bachelor’s degrees awarded. To
   determine the percentage, use majors, not headcount (e.g., students with one degree but a double major will be represented twice).
   Calculate the percentage from your institution’s IPEDS Completions by using the sum of 1st and 2nd majors for each CIP code as the
   numerator and the sum of the Grand Total by 1st Majors and the Grand Total by 2nd major as the denominator. If you prefer, you can
   compute the percentages using 1st majors only.

                                          Financial Aid Definitions

Awarded aid: The dollar amounts offered to financial aid applicants.

External scholarships and grants: Scholarships and grants received from outside (private) sources that
students bring with them (e.g., Kiwanis, National Merit scholarships). The institution may process paperwork
to receive the dollars, but it has no role in determining the recipient or the dollar amount awarded.
Financial aid applicant: Any applicant who submits any one of the institutionally required financial aid
applications/forms, such as the FAFSA.
Indebtedness: Aggregate dollar amount borrowed through any loan program (federal, state, subsidized,
unsubsidized, private, etc.; excluding parent loans) while the student was enrolled at an institution. Student
loans co-signed by a parent are assumed to be the responsibility of the student and should be included.

Institutional scholarships and grants: Endowed scholarships, annual gifts and tuition funded grants for
which the institution determines the recipient.
Financial need: As determined by your institution using the federal methodology and/or your institution's
own standards.
Need-based aid: College-funded or college-administered award from institutional, state, federal, or other
sources for which a student must have financial need to qualify. This includes both institutional and
noninstitutional student aid (grants, jobs, and loans).
Need-based scholarship or grant aid: Scholarships and grants from institutional, state, federal, or other
sources for which a student must have financial need to qualify.
Need-based self-help aid: Loans and jobs from institutional, state, federal, or other sources for which a
student must demonstrate financial need to qualify.
Non-need-based scholarship or grant aid: Scholarships and grants, gifts, or merit-based aid from
institutional, state, federal, or other sources (including unrestricted funds or gifts and endowment income)
awarded solely on the basis of academic achievement, merit, or any other non-need-based reason. When
reporting questions H1 and H2, non-need-based aid that is used to meet need should be counted as need-
based aid.
Note: Suggested order of precedence for counting non-need money as need-based:
Non-need institutional grants
Non-need tuition waivers
Non-need athletic awards
Non-need federal grants
Non-need state grants
Non-need outside grants
Non-need student loans
Non-need parent loans
Non-need work
