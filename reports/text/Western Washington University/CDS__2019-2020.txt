           The items in this section correspond to data elements collected by the IPEDS Web-based Data
           Collection System’s Graduation Rate Survey (GRS). For complete instructions and definitions of data

           For Bachelor's or Equivalent Institutions



           In the following section for bachelor’s or equivalent programs, please disaggregate the Fall 2012 and Fall
           2013 cohorts (formerly CDS B4-B11) into four groups:
           • Students who received a Federal Pell Grant*
           • Recipients of a subsidized Stafford Loan who did not receive a Pell Grant
           • Students who did not receive either a Pell Grant or a subsidized Stafford Loan
           • Total (all students, regardless of Pell Grant or subsidized loan status)
           *Students who received both a Federal Pell Grant and a subsidized Stafford Loan should be reported in
           the "Recipients of a Federal Pell Grant" column.
           For each graduation rate grid below, the numbers in the first three columns for Questions A-G should sum
           to the cohort total in the fourth column (formerly CDS B4-B11).

     submitted national standardized (SAT/ACT) test scores. Include information for ALL enrolled,
     degree-seeking, first-time, first-year (freshman) students who submitted test scores. Do not
     include partial test scores (e.g., mathematics scores but not critical reading for a category of
     students) or combine other standardized test results (such as TOEFL) in this item. Do not convert
     SAT scores to ACT scores and vice versa. If a student submitted multiple sets of scores for a
     single test, report this information according to how you use the data. For example:
     If you consider the highest scores from either submission, use the highest combination of scores
     (e.g., verbal from one submission, math from the other).
     If you average the scores, use the average to report the scores.

D17 Describe other transfer credit policies: Transfer credit is generally awarded for baccalaureate-oriented
    courses completed at institutions of higher education that have received accreditation by the Regional
    Associations of Schools and Colleges. College courses numbered below 100, technical and vocational
    courses, developmental education or remedial courses, English as a Second Language, sectarian
    religion courses, credit for life experience/travel, study skills courses, CLEP examination credit, and
    DANTES credit by examination do not transfer, regardless of an institution’s accreditation.
    WWU does not distinguish between transfer credit acceptance policies for 2- or 4-year institutions. A
    maximum of 135 quarter (90 semester) credits are allowed to transfer from any combination of regionally
    accredited institutions and only 105 quarter (70 semester) credits are allowed to transfer at the lower
    division level (typically numbered 100 and 200).

G1 Undergraduate full-time tuition, required fees, room and board List the typical tuition, required
   fees, and room and board for a full-time undergraduate student for the FULL 2020-2021 academic
   year (30 semester or 45 quarter hours for institutions that derive annual tuition by multiplying
   credit hour cost by number of credits). A full academic year refers to the period of time generally
   extending from September to June; usually equated to two semesters, two trimesters, three
   quarters, or the period covered by a four-one-four plan. Room and board is defined as double
   occupancy and 19 meals per week or the maximum meal plan. Required fees include only
   charges that all full-time students must pay that are not included in tuition (e.g., registration,
   health, or activity fees.) Do not include optional fees (e.g., parking, laboratory use).

     undergraduates) in the following categories. (Note: If the data being reported are final figures for the 2018-
     2019 academic year (see the next item below), use the 2018-2019 academic year's CDS Question B1
     cohort.) Include aid awarded to international students (i.e., those not qualifying for federal aid). Aid that is
     non-need-based but that was used to meet need should be reported in the need-based aid columns. (For
     a suggested order of precedence in assigning categories of aid to cover need, see the entry for “non-
     need-based scholarship or grant aid” on the last page of the definitions section.)

I3   Undergraduate Class Size
     In the table below, please use the following definitions to report information about the size of classes and
     class sections offered in the Fall 2019 term.
     Class Sections: A class section is an organized course offered for credit, identified by discipline and
     number, meeting at a stated time or times in a classroom or similar setting, and not a subsection such as
     a laboratory or discussion session. Undergraduate class sections are defined as any sections in which at
     least one degree-seeking undergraduate student is enrolled for credit. Exclude distance learning classes
     and noncredit classes and individual instruction such as dissertation or thesis research, music instruction,
     or one-to-one readings. Exclude students in independent study, co-operative programs, internships,
     foreign language taped tutor sessions, practicums, and all students in one-on-one classes. Each class
     section should be counted only once and should not be duplicated because of course catalog cross-
     listings.
     Class Subsections: A class subsection includes any subsection of a course, such as laboratory,
     recitation, and discussion subsections that are supplementary in nature and are scheduled to meet
     separately from the lecture portion of the course. Undergraduate subsections are defined as any
     subsections of courses in which degree-seeking undergraduate students enrolled for credit. As above,
     exclude noncredit classes and individual instruction such as dissertation or thesis research, music
     instruction, or one-to-one readings. Each class subsection should be counted only once and should not
     be duplicated because of cross-listings.
     Using the above definitions, please report for each of the following class-size intervals the number of
     class sections and class subsections offered in Fall 2019. For example, a lecture class with 800 students
     who met at another time in 40 separate labs with 20 students should be counted once in the “100+”
     column in the class section column and 40 times under the “20-29” column of the class subsections table.

                                       J. DEGREES CONFERRED
J1 Degrees conferred between July 1, 2018 and June 30, 2019
J1 For each of the following discipline areas, provide the percentage of diplomas/certificates, associate, and bachelor’s degrees awarded. To
   determine the percentage, use majors, not headcount (e.g., students with one degree but a double major will be represented twice).
   Calculate the percentage from your institution’s IPEDS Completions by using the sum of 1st and 2nd majors for each CIP code as the
   numerator and the sum of the Grand Total by 1st Majors and the Grand Total by 2nd major as the denominator. If you prefer, you can
   compute the percentages using 1st majors only.

Awarded aid: The dollar amounts offered to financial aid applicants.

External scholarships and grants: Scholarships and grants received from outside (private) sources that
students bring with them (e.g., Kiwanis, National Merit scholarships). The institution may process paperwork
to receive the dollars, but it has no role in determining the recipient or the dollar amount awarded.
Financial aid applicant: Any applicant who submits any one of the institutionally required financial aid
applications/forms, such as the FAFSA.
Indebtedness: Aggregate dollar amount borrowed through any loan program (federal, state, subsidized,
unsubsidized, private, etc.; excluding parent loans) while the student was enrolled at an institution. Student
loans co-signed by a parent are assumed to be the responsibility of the student and should be included.

Institutional scholarships and grants: Endowed scholarships, annual gifts and tuition funded grants for
which the institution determines the recipient.
Financial need: As determined by your institution using the federal methodology and/or your institution's
own standards.

awarded solely on the basis of academic achievement, merit, or any other non-need-based reason. When
reporting questions H1 and H2, non-need-based aid that is used to meet need should be counted as need-
based aid.

Non-need institutional grants
Non-need tuition waivers
Non-need athletic awards
Non-need federal grants
Non-need state grants
Non-need outside grants
Non-need student loans
Non-need parent loans
