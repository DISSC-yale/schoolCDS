    B4-B21: Graduation Rates
    The items in this section correspond to data elements collected by the IPEDS Web-based Data Collection
    System’s Graduation Rate Survey (GRS).
    • For complete instructions and definitions of data elements, see the IPEDS GRS Forms and
    Instructions
        for the 2020-2021 Survey. https://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/use-the-data/survey-components/9/graduation-
    rates
    In the following section for bachelor’s or equivalent programs, please disaggregate the Fall 2013 and
    Fall 2014 cohorts (formerly CDS B4-B11) into four groups:
    • Students who received a Federal Pell Grant*
    • Recipients of a subsidized Stafford Loan who did not receive a Pell Grant
    • Students who did not receive either a Pell Grant or a subsidized Stafford Loan
    • Total (all students, regardless of Pell Grant or subsidized loan status)

    *Students who received both a Federal Pell Grant and a subsidized Stafford Loan should be reported in the
    "Recipients of a Federal Pell Grant" column.

    For each graduation rate grid below, the numbers in the first three columns for Questions A-G should sum
    to the cohort total in the fourth column (formerly CDS B4-B11).
                                               For Bachelor’s or Equivalent Programs

    Please provide data for the Fall 2014 cohort if available. If Fall 2014 cohort data are not available, provide
    data for the Fall 2013 cohort.

     (freshman) students enrolled in Fall 2020, including students who began studies during summer,
     international students/nonresident aliens, and students admitted under special arrangements.

C9   Percent and number of first-time, first-year (freshman) students enrolled in Fall 2020 who submitted
     national standardized (SAT/ACT) test scores.
     •   Include information for ALL enrolled, degree-seeking, first-time, first-year (freshman) students
         who submitted test scores.
     •   Do not include partial test scores (e.g., mathematics scores but not critical reading for a category of
         students) or combine other standardized test results (such as TOEFL) in this item.
     •   Do not convert SAT scores to ACT scores and vice versa.
     •   If a student submitted multiple sets of scores for a single test, report this information according to how
         you use the data. For example:
          •   If you consider the highest scores from either submission, use the highest combination of scores
              (e.g., verbal from one submission, math from the other).
          •   If you average the scores, use the average to report the scores.

                                            H. FINANCIAL AID

     Aid Awarded to Enrolled Undergraduates
     Enter total dollar amounts awarded to enrolled full-time and less than full-time degree-seeking
     undergraduates (using the same cohort reported in CDS Question B1, “total degree-seeking”
     undergraduates) in the following categories. (Note: If the data being reported are final figures for the 2018-
     2019 academic year (see the next item below), use the 2018-2019 academic year's CDS Question B1
     cohort.) Include aid awarded to international students (i.e., those not qualifying for federal aid). Aid that is
     non-need-based but that was used to meet need should be reported in the need-based aid columns. (For
     a suggested order of precedence in assigning categories of aid to cover need, see the entry for “non-
     need-based scholarship or grant aid” on the last page of the definitions section.)

Common Data Set 2020-2021



I-3. Undergraduate Class Size
    In the table below, please use the following definitions to report information about the size of classes and
    class sections offered in the Fall 2020 term.
    • Please include classes that have been moved online in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

    Class Sections: A class section is an organized course offered for credit, identified by discipline and
    number, meeting at a stated time or times in a classroom or similar setting, and not a subsection such as
    a laboratory or discussion session. Undergraduate class sections are defined as any sections in which at
    least one degree-seeking undergraduate student is enrolled for credit. Exclude distance learning classes
    and noncredit classes and individual instruction such as dissertation or thesis research, music instruction,
    or one-to-one readings. Exclude students in independent study, co-operative programs, internships,
    foreign language taped tutor sessions, practicums, and all students in one-on-one classes. Each class
    section should be counted only once and should not be duplicated because of course catalog cross-
    listings.
    Class Subsections: A class subsection includes any subsection of a course, such as laboratory,
    recitation, and discussion subsections that are supplementary in nature and are scheduled to meet
    separately from the lecture portion of the course. Undergraduate subsections are defined as any
    subsections of courses in which degree-seeking undergraduate students enrolled for credit. As above,
    exclude noncredit classes and individual instruction such as dissertation or thesis research, music
    instruction, or one-to-one readings. Each class subsection should be counted only once and should not
    be duplicated because of cross-listings.
    Using the above definitions, please report for each of the following class-size intervals the number of
    class sections and class subsections offered in Fall 2020. For example, a lecture class with 800 students
    who met at another time in 40 separate labs with 20 students should be counted once in the “100+”
    column in the class section column and 40 times under the “20-29” column of the class subsections table.

                                    J. Disciplinary areas of DEGREES CONFERRED
J1 Degrees conferred between July 1, 2019 and June 30, 2020
   For each of the following discipline areas, provide the percentage of diplomas/certificates, associate, and bachelor’s degrees awarded. To
   determine the percentage, use majors, not headcount (e.g., students with one degree but a double major will be represented twice).
   Calculate the percentage from your institution’s IPEDS Completions by using the sum of 1st and 2nd majors for each CIP code as the
   numerator and the sum of the Grand Total by 1st Majors and the Grand Total by 2nd major as the denominator. If you prefer, you can
   compute the percentages using 1st majors only.

the FAFSA.

Indebtedness: Aggregate dollar amount borrowed through any loan program (federal, state, subsidized, unsubsidized, private, etc.;

determines the recipient.

Financial need: As determined by your institution using the federal methodology and/or your institution's own standards.

sources (including unrestricted funds or gifts and endowment income) awarded solely on the basis of academic achievement, merit, or
any other non-need-based reason. When reporting questions H1 and H2, non-need-based aid that is used to meet need should be
counted as need-based aid.
