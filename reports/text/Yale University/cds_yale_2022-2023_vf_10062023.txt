B2   Enrollment by Racial/Ethnic Category.
     Provide numbers of undergraduate students for each of the following categories as of the institution’s official fall reporting date or as of October
     19, 2022.
     • Include international students only in the category "Nonresidents."
     • Complete the “Total Undergraduates” column only if you cannot provide data for the first two columns.
     • Report as your institution reports to IPEDS: persons who are Hispanic should be reported only on the
         Hispanic line, not under any race, and persons who are non-Hispanic multi-racial should be reported only
         under "Two or more races."
     • New guidance from IPEDS for reporting aggregate data:
     Racial/ethnic designations are requested only for United States citizens, residents, and other eligible non-citizens.
     Eligible non-citizens include all students who completed high school or a GED equivalency within the United States
     (including DACA and undocumented students) and who were not on an F-1 non-immigrant student visa at the time of
     high school graduation.
     More information about other eligible (for financial aid purposes) non-citizens is available at
     https://studentaid.gov/understandaid/eligibility/requirements/non-us-citizens.

     B4-B21: Graduation Rates
     The items in this section correspond to data elements collected by the IPEDS Web-based Data Collection System’s Graduation Rate Survey
     (GRS).

     •   For complete instructions and definitions of data elements, see the IPEDS GRS Forms and Instructions
         for the 2022-2023 Survey. https://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/use-the-data/survey-components/9/graduation-rates


     In the following section for bachelor’s or equivalent programs, please disaggregate the Fall 2015 and Fall 2016 cohorts (formerly CDS B4-B11) into four groups:
     • Students who received a Federal Pell Grant*
     • Recipients of a subsidized Stafford Loan who did not receive a Pell Grant
     • Students who did not receive either a Pell Grant or a subsidized Stafford Loan
     • Total (all students, regardless of Pell Grant or subsidized loan status)

     *Students who received both a Federal Pell Grant and a subsidized Stafford Loan should be reported in the "Recipients of a Federal Pell Grant" column.

     For each graduation rate grid below, the numbers in the first three columns for Questions A-G should sum to the cohort total in the fourth column (formerly CDS B4-B11).

     standardized (SAT/ACT) test scores.
     •    Include information for ALL enrolled, degree-seeking, first-time, first-year students who submitted
          test scores.
     •    Do not include partial test scores (e.g., mathematics scores but not critical reading for a category of
          students) or combine other standardized test results (such as TOEFL) in this item.
     •    Do not convert SAT scores to ACT scores and vice versa.
     •    If a student submitted multiple sets of scores for a single test, report this information according to how
          you use the data. For example:
     •    If you consider the highest scores from either submission, use the highest combination of scores
          (e.g., verbal from one submission, math from the other).
     •    If you average the scores, use the average to report the scores.

                                           H. FINANCIAL AID
     Please refer to the following financial aid definitions when completing Section H.
     Awarded aid: The dollar amounts offered to financial aid applicants.
     Financial aid applicant: Any applicant who submits any one of the institutionally required financial aid
     applications/forms, such as the FAFSA.
     Indebtedness: Aggregate dollar amount borrowed through any loan program (federal, state, subsidized,
     unsubsidized, private, etc.; excluding parent loans) while the student was enrolled at an institution.
     Student loans co-signed by a parent are assumed to be the responsibility of the student and should be
     included.
     Institutional scholarships and grants: Endowed scholarships, annual gifts and tuition funded grants for
     which the institution determines the recipient.
     Financial need: As determined by your institution using the federal methodology and/or your institution's
     own standards.
     Need-based aid: College-funded or college-administered award from institutional, state, federal, or other
     sources for which a student must have financial need to qualify. This includes both institutional and non-
     institutional student aid (grants, jobs, and loans).
     Need-based scholarship or grant aid: Scholarships and grants from institutional, state, federal, or other
     sources for which a student must have financial need to qualify.
     Need-based self-help aid: Loans and jobs from institutional, state, federal, or other sources for which a
     student must demonstrate financial need to qualify.
     Non-need-based scholarship or grant aid: Scholarships and grants, gifts, or merit-based aid from
     institutional, state, federal, or other sources (including unrestricted funds or gifts and endowment income)
     awarded solely on the basis of academic achievement, merit, or any other non-need-based reason. When
     reporting questions H1 and H2, non-need-based aid that is used to meet need should be counted as
     need-based aid.
     Note: Suggested order of precedence for counting non-need money as need-based:
        1. Non-need institutional grants                       6. Non-need outside grants
        2. Non-need tuition waivers                            7. Non-need student loans
        3. Non-need athletic awards                            8. Non-need parent loans
        4. Non-need federal grants                             9. Non-need work
        5. Non-need state grants
     Non-need-based self-help aid: Loans and jobs from institutional, state, or other sources for which a
     student need not demonstrate financial need to qualify.
     Private student loans: A nonfederal loan made by a lender such as a bank, credit union or private
     lender used to pay for up to the annual cost of education, less any financial aid received.
     External scholarships and grants: Scholarships and grants received from outside (private) sources that
     students bring with them (e.g., Kiwanis, National Merit scholarships). The institution may process
     paperwork to receive the dollars, but it has no role in determining the recipient or the dollar amount
     Work study and employment: Federal and state work study aid, and any employment packaged by your
     institution in financial aid awards.

Common Data Set 2022-2023




    In the table below, please use the following definitions to report information about the size of classes and
    class sections offered in the Fall 2022 term.
    • Please include classes that have been moved online in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

    Class Sections: A class section is an organized course offered for credit, identified by discipline and
    number, meeting at a stated time or times in a classroom or similar setting, and not a subsection such as
    a laboratory or discussion session. Undergraduate class sections are defined as any sections in which at
    least one degree-seeking undergraduate student is enrolled for credit. Exclude distance learning classes
    and noncredit classes and individual instruction such as dissertation or thesis research, music instruction,
    or one-to-one readings. Exclude students in independent study, co-operative programs, internships,
    foreign language taped tutor sessions, practicums, and all students in one-on-one classes. Each class
    section should be counted only once and should not be duplicated because of course catalog cross-
    listings.
    Class Subsections: A class subsection includes any subsection of a course, such as laboratory,
    recitation, and discussion subsections that are supplementary in nature and are scheduled to meet
    separately from the lecture portion of the course. Undergraduate subsections are defined as any
    subsections of courses in which degree-seeking undergraduate students enrolled for credit. As above,
    exclude noncredit classes and individual instruction such as dissertation or thesis research, music
    instruction, or one-to-one readings. Each class subsection should be counted only once and should not
    be duplicated because of cross-listings.
    Using the above definitions, please report for each of the following class-size intervals the number of
    class sections and class subsections offered in Fall 2022. For example, a lecture class with 800 students
    who met at another time in 40 separate labs with 20 students should be counted once in the “100+”
    column in the class section column and 40 times under the “20-29” column of the class subsections table.

                                   J. Disciplinary areas of DEGREES CONFERRED
J1 Degrees conferred between July 1, 2021 and June 30, 2022
   For each of the following discipline areas, provide the percentage of diplomas/certificates, associate, and bachelor’s degrees awarded. To
   determine the percentage, use majors, not headcount (e.g., students with one degree but a double major will be represented twice).
   Calculate the percentage from your institution’s IPEDS Completions by using the sum of 1st and 2nd majors for each CIP code as the
   numerator and the sum of the Grand Total by 1st Majors and the Grand Total by 2nd major as the denominator. If you prefer, you can
   compute the percentages using 1st majors only.

*Academic advisement: Plan under which each student is assigned to a faculty member or a trained adviser, who, through regular
meetings, helps the student plan and implement immediate and long-term academic and vocational goals.
Accelerated program: Completion of a college program of study in fewer than the usual number of years, most often by attending
summer sessions and carrying extra courses during the regular academic term.
Admitted student: Applicant who is offered admission to a degree-granting program at your institution.
